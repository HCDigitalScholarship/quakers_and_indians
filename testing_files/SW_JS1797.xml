                <p>The manuscript of Joshua Sharpless’ “Journal [Visit to Upper Canada and Parts
                    Adjacent]” (1797) is housed at Friends Historical Library, on the campus of
                    Swarthmore College. In the spring semester of 2012, Swarthmore students enrolled
                    in English 57A (“Early American Literature Through A Traveler’s Eyes”)
                    transcribed Sharpless’s manuscript as part of a larger project to make the
                    library’s rich store of Quaker journal writings more accessible to researchers.
                    The project was designed by Christopher Densmore, curator of Friends Historical
                    Library, and Keat Murray, Visiting Associate Professor of English. Transcribers
                    included: David Fialkow (1-14), Epiphany English (15-42), Keat Murray (43-51),
                    and Sarah Scheub (52-87). Students’ transcriptions were compiled and edited in
                    the present form by Professor Murray.</p>
            </projectDesc>
            <editorialDecl> <p>Because the manuscript does not include page numbers, the transcribers have
                interpolated page numbers. The transcribers and editor attempted to
                    render Sharpless’s orthography and grammar as they appear on the page of his
                    journal, even when Sharpless’s own spelling and usage are inconsistent. </p></editorialDecl>
