                    To the Indians<br/>Assembled at the Rapids of the <a href="#miamr1" class="placeName">Miami</a><br/>Brothers,
                
                <p>We who send you this Letter are of the<br/>People called Quakers, and have left
                    our homes and Families<br/>in Pensylvania &amp; New Jersy and taken this long
                    Journey to<br/>see you purely from motives of Love and good Will, and<br/>to
                    endeavour to promote peace. We have been now five<br/>Weeks at <a href="#detro" class="placeName">Detroit</a> waiting for the opening of the Treaty
                        at<br/><a href="#sandu" class="placeName">Sandusky</a>, where we expected to
                    have seen you all, but as<br/>we have heard a number of your People are gone to
                        <a href="#niag" class="placeName">Niagara</a><br/>to meet the Commissioners, we
                    do not know but the business<br/> may be so concluded there, as that they may
                    come no further</p>
                <p>Brothers,<br/>We have brought with us an Address<br/>to you from our
                    Brothers at Home, which we are very<br/>desirous of presenting to you with our
                    own hands, if an<br/>opportunity can be had. It is also in our Hearts
                    to<br/>acquaint you that we consider all Men as the Children<br/>of one common
                    Father, and think it our duty to Love all<br/>as Brothers. We believe it
                    displeases the Great &amp; Good Spirit<br/>when Men injure and kill one another,
                    therefore we <del>en-</del><br/>endeavour to do Justice but when any despute
                    arises, we leave it to be settled by disinterested &amp; impartial<br/>persons
                    and never go to war on any occasion <br/>We have<br/>been made very
                    sorrowful on account of the War and <br/>Bloodshed between the United States and
                    our Indian Brethren,<br/>and want much to see you, that we may open
                    our<br/>hearts more fully than we can do by writing, for <br/> we <br/>
                    <pb/> we are fully convinced that by looking up to the Great Spirit<br/>for
                    Counsel, all differences may be settled without fighting<br/>and killing one
                    another, which we think is very cruel, and<br/>attended with many distressing
                    circumstances both to you<br/>and the White People. Our Society have experienced
                    for<br/>more than One hundred Years great advantage and<br/>satisfaction in
                    living peacably with all Men, and are<br/>very desirous you may enjoy the same
                    benefits, and<br/>to that and were made willing to expose
                    themselves,<br/>encounter hardships and spend our substance to promote<br/>peace
                    and Love between you, and the Government of<br/>the United States.</p>
                <p>We Pray the Good Spirit that He may put an end<br/>to the ravages of War and
                    unite all Men as Brothers, that<br/>being bound together by one great Chain of
                    Love and<br/>Friendship that cannot be broken, we may all seek<br/>the happiness
                    of each other in this Life, and be prepared<br/>for the enjoyment of everlasting
                    happiness in the Life<br/>which is to come
                </p>
