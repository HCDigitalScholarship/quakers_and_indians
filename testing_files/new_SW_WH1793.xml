                    the channel, 6 or 7 miles up<br/> to its present situation &#8211; from a high
                    point<br/> on the West Bank, had a view of the River<br/> down to the Lake, and

                    places 6 or 8 feet,<br/> this prodigious body of water, conjectured to be<br/>
                    more than double the quantity that comes down<br/> the Falls of Delaware near

                    3 or 4 feet perpendicular, this greatly en-<br/>creases the rapiddity of the
                    current, until it comes<br/> to the edge of the Precipice, over which it dashes
                        -<del><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></del></p>
                <p> The River at the Falls is divided by a small<br/> flat Island, of perhaps 250
                    yards in width, and twice<br/> that number in length - the sides and upper
                    end,<br/> not much elevated above the surface of the River<br/> above the Falls,
                    the lower end, which is on a line<br/> with the Falls, is a smooth perpendicular
                    Rook, I suppose<br/> of about 150 feet high.- The edge of the Rock over<br/>
                    which the water Falls, on the East side of the Island,<br/><del/>, is
                    nearly a straight line,<br/> and the River, on that side, I suppose to be 250
                    yards<br/> wide, but the Water not so deep as on the West side<br/>
                    <pb n="19" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_14"/> where its width is the
                        same<del/> - the<br/> edge of the Rook, on this side, forms near
                        about<del/><br/> half a Circle, the convex side
                        upwards<del><br/><br/></del><br/> --The quantity of Water
                    that passes on the West side,<br/> I suppose to be double that which passes on
                    the<br/> East side of the Island, being in the middle 6 or 8<br/> feet deep
                    above the Falls.- It is said that by<br/> actual survey there is found to be 50
                    feet fall in the<br/> one mile of Rapids just above the Falls, and<br/> from
                    thence down to the Landing, 6 or 7 miles,<br/> the rappidity of the River
                    renders it altogether<br/> impassable, in that distance the fall must be<br/>
                    very considerable, so that taking the whole<br/> into view, we may conclude,
                    that the surface<br/> of the Water of <a href="#lakee" class="geogName">Lake

                    pleas'd,<br/> and assured us of their hearty friendship<br/> - but the next day
                    exhibited a very different<br/> scene - the War dance&#173; Captain John<br/> and
                    most of his party were drunk - they<br/> were almost naked and frightfully
                    painted<br/> which with their Yells, musick and Tomahocks<br/> afforded an
                    entertainment, by no means<br/> pleasing - before they came to the door of<br/>
                    our Lodging, Captain John, who did<br/>
                    <pb n="24" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_17"/> not join in the Dance, came forward, to
                    assure<br/> us, that no injury was intended - We were obliged<br/> to give them
                    a little Cyder and Tobacco. - It is a<br/> regulation in this Garrison that no

                    of a grey or grisly colour. - his legs<br/> were as long as those of a large
                    Deer, his Tail long<br/> and tapering, thinly covered with long hair, and<br/>
                    his head in shape between that of a Dog and Fox.</p>

                <p> Had an interview with a Young <a href="#shawnee" class="orgName">Shaw-<br/>-nese</a>
                    Warrior, who is lately from the Council<br/> at the Rapids - his Brother is a
                    head Man<br/> amongst them, and he being often with<br/> them in Council, is
                    acquainted with the result<br/> of their deliberations, so far as they have
                    come<br/> to a conclusion among themselves - he inform'd<br/> us, there are
                    about 1200 collected at the Rapids,<br/> mostly the Northern Indians, and 700
                    of<br/> the Southern Indians, are embodied at<br/> another place, a considerable
                    distance,<br/> up the same River, watching the motions of <a href="#gwayn1" class="persName">General Waynes</a><br/> Army.&#173; he confirms the account of a<br/>
                    Deputation being sent to the Commissioners,<br/> and that the object of their
                    Mission was, in<br/> substance, the same as has already been<br/> noted - that
                    they have most decidedly come<br/>
                    <pb n="45" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_28"/> to a resolution, to accept of no terms
                    short of<br/> making the <a href="#ohior" class="geogName">Ohio</a> the boundary
                    line. - Our<br/> Interpretter was formerly a Prisoner among the<br/>
                    <a href="#shawnee" class="orgName">Shawnese</a>, and had been adopted into the
                    family<br/> of this Young Man, in the place of his Father,<br/> and in their
                    discourse the Indian gave him<br/> that appellation, saying, my Father, I will<br/> tell you what I know, and speak
                        the truth - in<br/> the begining of the World, this Land was given<br/> to
                        the Indians, and the White People were placed<br/> beyond the great water -
                        when the white Men<br/> first came to this Land, the wise old Men<br/> among
                        the Indians, told their People, that if<br/> they received anything of the
                        white Men, they<br/> would be destroyed,&#173; "the bitter Water was made<br/>
                        for white folks, but the Water of the Brooks and<br/> Rivers for, the
                        Indians, - but not regarding<br/> this advice, many of the Nations
                    Traded with<br/> the Whites, took their Hatchets, Knives and<br/> Rum, and gave
                    up their Land for trifles,<br/> and, according to the ancient prediction,
                    they<br/> have wasted away, and some of them -<br/> become quite extinct, and
                    the few that<br/> are remaining are driven, almost to<br/>
                    <pb n="46" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_29"/> to where the sun sets, but they are
                    now<br/> determined to be driven no further, should<br/> they go to where the
                    Sun sets, they would<br/> all be lost forever. - The Congress must<br/> remove
                    their Forts, and all their People over<br/> the River, and then the Indians will
                    take<br/> them by the hand, and become their true<br/> friends - but should the
                    Commissioners<br/> meet the Indians in Council, and there<br/> pretend that they
                    have conquered their<br/> Country, and will not remove out of it, in<br/> that
                    case, the Indians will withdraw from<br/> the Council, and then, instantly, fall
                    upon<br/> the opposite party, and destroy them all -<br/> this is the substance

                    its<br/> prospects, - The Lots are all regularly laid<br/> out, being in front
                    three square Acres<br/> only in breadth, on which are the build-<br/>-ings,
                    Gardens and Orchards.- In the<br/> afternoon of this day arrived the Sloop<br/>
                    Speedwell from <a href="#ferie" class="placeName">Fort Erie</a>, who furnished<br/>
                    us with intelligence from various-<br/> quarters.- we had several Letters

                    <pb n="54" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_33"/> jointly, and most of our friends had<br/>
                    particular accounts from their dear<br/> connections at Home. - we had also<br/>
                    a joint letter from <a href="#cpick1" class="persName">Col Pickering</a>, in<br/>
                    behalf of the Commissioners, with a large<br/> bundle of Philadelphia Newspapers
                    as<br/> late as the 6th ultimo. -- <a href="#cpick1" class="persName">Col.
                        Pickering</a><br/> informs us they were all on board, and<br/> ready
                    to Sail, when the Indian Deputies<br/> arrived, who informed the
                    Commissioners,<br/> their business was to have a conference<br/> with them in
                    the presence of <a href="#gsimc1" class="persName">Governor<br/> Simcoe</a>, this he
                    says will unavoidably<br/> occasion a delay of some days, if not<br/> supersede
                    the intended Treaty.- we<br/> are now anxiously waiting the arrival<br/> of the
                    Dunmore, who in all probability,<br/> will either bring forward the
                    Commissioners,<br/> or information that all hopes of a<br/> Treaty are
                    vanished.</p>

                            Quakers, and have<br/> left our homes and families in Pensylvania<br/>
                            and New Jersey, and taken this long Journey<br/> to see you purely from
                            motives of Love and<br/> good will, and to endeavour to promote<br/>
                            peace.- We have been now five weeks at<br/> Detroit waiting for the
                            opening of the Treaty<br/> at <a href="#sandu" class="placeName">Sandusky</a>, where we expected to have seen<br/> you all,

                        <p> Brothers, We have brought with us an<br/> address to you from our
                            Brethren at home<br/> which we are very desirous of presenting to<br/>
                            you with our own hands, if an opportunity<br/> can be had. - it is also
                            in our hearts to<br/> acquaint you that we consider all Men<br/> as the
                            Children of one common Father, and<br/> think it our duty to Love all as
                            Brothers.<br/> -We believe it displeases the Great and Good<br/> Spirit
                            when Men injure and kill one<br/> another, therefore we endeavour to do
                            Justice,<br/> but when any dispute arises, we leave it<br/> to be
                            settled by disinterested and impartial<br/> persons, and never go to war
                            on any-<br/> occasion.- We have been made very<br/> sorrowful on account
                            of the War and bloodshed<br/> between the United States and our
                            Indian<br/> Brethren, and want much to see you<br/> that we may open our
                            Hearts more<br/> fully than we can do by writing, for we<br/>
                            <pb n="58" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_35"/> are fully convinced that by
                            looking up<br/> to the Great Spirit for Counsel, all differences<br/>
                            may be settled without fighting and killing<br/> one another, which we
                            think is very<br/> Cruel and attended with many distressing<br/>
                            circumstances both to you and the White People.</p>
                        <p> Our society have experienced for more<br/> than one hundred years great
                            advantage<br/> and satisfaction in living Peaceably with<br/> all Men,
                            and are very desirous that you<br/> may enjoy the same benefits, and to
                            that<br/> end were made willing to expose ourselves,<br/> encounter
                            hardships, and spend our sub-<br/>stance to promote Peace and Love
                            between<br/> you and the Government of the United<br/> States.- We pray
                            the Good Spirit<br/> that He may put an end to the ravages<br/> of War
                            and unite all Men as Brethren,<br/> that by being bound together in one
                            great<br/> Chain of Love and friendship which <del>can</del><br/> cannot
                            be broken, we may all seek the<br/> happiness of each other in this
                            Life, and<br/> be <del>prepared</del> prepared for
                            the enjoyment of<br/>
                            <pb n="59" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_35"/> of everlasting happiness in the

                <p> Some of our Friends had an interview<br/> with a Person of the Name of Wilbank,
                    who-<br/> within a few days past arrived, with a Party<br/> of 26 Southern
                    Indians, from the back parts of<br/> the Carolina's and Georgia, at the Great
                    Council<br/> at the Miami, - he came from thence to this<br/> place, and a
                    Vessel is to be dispatched immediately<br/> to carry him down to <a href="#gsimc1" class="persName">Governor Simcoe</a>. He says,<br/> that the Indians have
                    in several instances<br/> been grossly imposed upon, particularly by<br/>
                    <a href="#gblou1" class="persName">Governor Blount</a>, who by bribing an
                    Interpreter<br/> had cheated them out of a great extent of<br/> Country, and
                    defrauded them of one half<br/> the Sum, agreed upon to be paid yearly, as<br/>
                    as a compensation for the Land granted,-<br/> in one instance where they had
                    agreed to<br/> sell 50 miles square they had fraudulently<br/> put in the Deed
                    80 miles - and where they had<br/>
                    <pb n="60" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_36"/> had bargained for an extent of 10
                    miles<br/> round the Town of Nashville, <a href="#gblou1" class="persName">Governor
                        Blount</a><br/> had caused 40 miles to be inserted.- and instead<br/>
                    of a Consideration of 2000 Dollars yearly, he had<br/> put down but 1000
                    dollars.- This being but<br/> one side of the question, we do not pretend
                    to<br/> Judge, but it is the received opinion here, that<br/> their errand to
                    the Council is, to form a Union<br/> with the Northern Indians, and make
                    One<br/> common cause, either in forming a Treaty,<br/> or carrying on a War. -
                    The Vessell (the Felicity) to Carry<br/> Wilbank to <a href="#ferie" class="placeName">Fort
                        Erie</a>, sail'd about 2 oClock:-<br/> - Yesterday a young Man going
                    out to look<br/> for Horses, got lost in the Woods, which are very<br/> thick
                    within less than a Mile of the Fort.-<br/> several 18 pounders were fired in the
                    afternoon<br/> in order to direct him in finding the way back,<br/> which, I
                    suppose had the desired effect, as I am<br/> informed he got safe home in the
                    Evening -<br/>- several instances of the kind have before<br/> occurred, and
                    sometimes the persons lost have<br/> never returned. - It is said some little
                    time<br/> past, two Indians were kill'd by the Wolves<br/> in the Neighbourhood
                    of this place.</p>

                <p> The Indians came over about 10 oClock, but<br/> were informed that an answer
                    would not be ready<br/> for them before 5 in the afternoon,- about<br/> that
                    time the Deputies assembled, and <a href="#cpick1" class="persName">Col.<br/>

                    making them wait so long for<br/> an answer.- He then according to the<br/>
                    Indian custom, repeated over the Contents of<br/> the written message brought
                    from the Council<br/> at the Miami, and proceed to read a very<br/>
                    <pb n="72" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_42"/> lengthy answer, which in the first
                    place<br/> pointed out the improbability of any part of<br/> the business being
                    misunderstood at the conference<br/> at <a href="#fniag" class="placeName">Niagara</a>, and stated such facts as made<br/> it appear that such
                    a pretence could be<br/> nothing less than want of sincerity.-
                    <del>men</del><br/> -mention was then made of the several<br/> Treaties
                    concluded since the establishment<br/> of the Independance of the United States,
                    and<br/> of the new settlements made in consequence<br/> of those treaties, and
                    of the impossibility of<br/> removing such a great number of Families<br/> from
                    their habitations and Farms; and<br/> therefore, in the most explicit terms
                        <del>de-</del><br/><del>clared</del> declared that the United States
                    could<br/> not agree that the<a href="#ohior" class="geogName"> River Ohio</a> should
                    be<br/> the boundary line.- In the next place<br/> the Commissioners
                    acknowledged that very<br/> improper Language had been held out at<br/> former
                    Treaties, when it had been said that<br/> the United States claimed all the
                    Indian Coun<br/>-try, (within certain limits mark'd out by<br/> the Treaty of
                    Peace with the British) as a con-<br/>quer'd Country.- The Commissioners<br/>
                    <pb n="73" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_42"/> therefore, in the clearest terms, now
                    relin-<br/>-quishd all such claim, reserving only the<br/> preemption, or
                    exclusive right of purchasing<br/> of the Indians.- The Commissioners then<br/>
                    express'd their desires to meet the Indians in<br/> full Council, and a belief
                    that if such <del/><br/><del>work</del> a thing
                    could be done, and a friendly<br/> conference take place, a satisfactory and
                    lasting<br/> Peace would be the consequence - They<br/> concluded with
                    intimating that for the<br/> sake of an accommodation they would be<br/> willing
                    to give up all the Land to the N.W. of the<br/>
                    <a href="#ohior" class="geogName">Ohio</a>, excepting such only as were
                    absolutely~<br/> appropriated, and, for such as were appropri-<br/>-ated, a
                    generous compensation should be<br/> paid down, and a yearly Rent allowed<br/>
                    forever.- The answer was interpretted<br/> paragraphically as it was read, and
                    then<br/> the whole writing given to the Indians.</p>
                <p> -The old Wiandot Chief who delivered the<br/> message yesterday, got up and
                    said, as the<br/>sun was going down they would consider of what was said by<br/>
                    the Commissioners <del>answer</del> and speak a few<br/> words to them in the

                <p> - The Indians came over about<br/> 7 oClock in the morning, and having met
                    the<br/> Commissioners in Council - the old Chief<br/> who spoke last night
                    arose, and said, they<br/> perfectly understood all that was said to them<br/>
                    yesterday, and had only to say, that in<br/> regard to the several Treaties
                    mentioned<br/> yesterday, they did not acknowledge any of<br/> them to be valid,
                    and as the Commissioners<br/> had said they could not remove the white<br/>
                    People over the River, so they, the Indians,<br/> could not consent to give up
                    any of their<br/> Country, and concluded with saying,<br/> they came as Men
                    wishing for Peace,<br/> but as that could not be obtained, they<br/> should
                    return to their Council, and speak<br/> to their warriors:- And as for the
                    Commissioners.<br/> they <del>the Indians</del> had nothing more to say to<br/>
                    them, they might go home, and tell <del>the</del><br/><del>President</del>
                    Washington what the Indians had said.-</p>
                <p> -After the Indians had retired a few minutes,<br/>
                    <a href="#sgirt1" class="persName">Simon Girty</a> their interpretter, and several
                    of<br/> their Chiefs, came back, and said, there had<br/> been a mistake in the

                    <pb n="75" facs="SW_WH1793_Page_43"/> speech - that the business of the
                    Deputies<br/> was to carry the Commissioners answer to the<br/> Great Council,
                    and they desired the Comissnrs.<br/> would wait a few days for a final
                    answer.</p>
                <p> -The Indians then immediately took their<br/> leave, and <a href="#tmcke1" class="persName">Thos. McKee</a>, about 11 oClock also<br/> set off for the <a href="#miamr" class="geogName">Miami</a>, and as the prospect of meeting<br/> the

                    dullness and stupidity<br/> seemed to be spread over his Countenance, and<br/>

                    the<br/> substance of this lengthy reply, which fill'd<br/> near two sheets of
                    Paper was, that no consi-<br/>-deration would induce the Indians to<br/> give up
                    their Country, and nothing short<br/> of making the <a href="#ohior" class="geogName">Ohio</a> the boundary could give<br/> them satisfaction, and if the
                    Commissioners<br/> could not agree to this there would be no use<br/> in meeting
                    at a Treaty - The answer was<br/> signed, it is said, by sixteen Nations,
                    being<br/> all that were present except the Six<br/> Nations, who all refused
                    their concurrence<br/> and are favourably disposed towards the<br/> United
                    States.- About 8 P.M. the two<br/> young <a href="#onondaga" class="orgName">Onondaga</a>'s return'd who were<br/> sent express by the
                    Commissioners, as<br/> mentioned the <a when="1793-08-14">14th</a>, they
                    brought no<br/> written reply, and could give very little in-<br/>formation,
                    except that they delivered their<br/> message to <a href="#cbran1" class="persName">Capt.
