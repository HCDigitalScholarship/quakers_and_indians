                 To the children of the Friends of <a href="#wpenn1" class="persName"> Onas
                        </a> who first set- <br/>led in Pennsylvania -- The request of the
                            <a href="#cornp2" class="persName">Cornplanter</a> a <br/> chief of the
                            <a href="#seneca" class="orgName">Seneca</a> nation <br/>
                    Brothers,
                <p> The <a href="#seneca" class="orgName"> Seneca </a> nation see that the Great spirit
                    <br/> intends that they shall not continue to live by hunting, <br/> and they
                    look round on every side, and enquire who it <br/> is that shall teach them what
                    is best for them to do. <br/> Your Fathers have dealt fairly and honestly with
                    <br/> our Fathers, and they have charged us to remember <br/> it, and we think
                    it right to tell you, that we <br/> wish our children to be taught the same
                    principes <br/> by which your fathers were guided in their councils. </p>
                <p> Brothers, <br/> We have too little wisdom among us: <br/> We cannot teach our
                    children what we perceive their <br/> situation requires them to know, and we
                    therefore <br/> ask you to instruct some of them We wish them to be <br/>
                    instructed to read and to write, and such other things <br/> as you teach your
                    children; and especially, to teach <br/> them to love peace. </p>
                <p> Brothers, <br/> We desire of you to take under your <br/> care two <a href="#seneca" class="orgName"> Seneca </a> boys and teach them as your own; <br/> and,
                    in order that they may be satisfied to remain with <br/> you and be easy in
                    their minds, that you will take <br/> with them the son of our Interpreter and
                    teach him <br/> also according to his desire.</p>
                <p>Brothers, <br/> You know that it is not in our power to <br/> pay<br/> <pb/>pay you
                    for the education of these three boys -- and therefore you <br/>must, if you do this
                    thing, look up to God for your reward.</p>
                <p>Brothers,<br/>You will consider of
                    this request, and let us <br/>know what you determine to do. If your hearts <br/>are
                    enclined toward us, and you will afford our nation <br/>this great advantage, I will
                    send my son as one of the <br/>boys to receive your instruction, and at the time
                    which <br/>you shall appoint.</p>
