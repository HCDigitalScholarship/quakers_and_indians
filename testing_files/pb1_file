                        establishing<br/>peace between them &amp; the United
                    States.
                <p>Brothers<br/>When a time was agreed on <a when="1793">two years since</a>,
                    for kindling<br/>Council fire at <a href="#sandu" class="placeName">Sandusky</a>,
                    our hearts were made to rejoice, in hope the<br/>good work of peace would go
                    forward; Six of our Brothers took a long journey<br/>to see <del/>you at that
                    time, under a desire of affording their assistance<br/>to make the Council fire
                    burn bright, but by the working of that bad Spirit<br/>which the
                    happiness of all Men, <del>that</del> the intended Treaty was frustrated, and
                        our<br/><del>said</del>friends were under the painful necessity of returning
                    home with the<br/>sorrowful tidings, that War, the sad destroyer of Mankind, was
                    likely to be<br/>continued; since which the accounts received from your Country
                    of as much<br/>Blood being shed <del>on both sides</del> have occasioned our
                    lamentation &amp; mourning.</p>
                <p>Brothers<br/>We then sent you an Address, <del>accompanied with a small present
                        <br/>as a Token of our Love and rememberance of you, which our said six
                        friends <br/>entrusted</del> wch way <del>committed</del> directed by our sd
                    6 Frnds <br/>to the care of <a href="#cmcke1" class="persName">Col. McKee</a>
                    <del/>but as we have <del/>had no<br/>information of your having received it, we
                    herewith send you a Copy. A<br/>small present, as a token of our love &amp; and
                    remembrance of you, was also sent by our Brethren abovement.<br/>which they had
                    not the satisfaction of delivering to you.</p>
                <p>Brothers<br/>It affords us much Comfort that a stop is so far put to the
                    further<br/>effusion of Blood, and we earnestly desire that in the Council
                    fire<br/>now about to be kindled, your trust &amp; dependance may be on the
                    Great<br/>over ruling Spirit of Peace &amp; Love, whereby he may be pleased so
                    to influence &amp; direct<br/>your Councils as that the sound of War may no more
                    be heard in your<br/>Land.</p>
                <p>Brothers<br/>We have often been grieved at beholding the sad effects
                        <del>eperienced by</del> produced in unguarded Men of whatever Nation from
                        <del>which</del><br/>the exessive use of strong drink <del>produce</del> and
                    particularly on the <del>Red</del> Indian people, even when<br/>deliberating on
                    the solemn Business of Treaties which are intended to bind them and<br/>their
                    posterity to future Generations, and are anxiously solicitous that <del>in
                        <br/>the present Treaty it may be</del> you may be weisly  determined
                    to take up a pious resolution to abstain-</html>
