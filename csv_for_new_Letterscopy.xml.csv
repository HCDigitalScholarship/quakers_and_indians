                The People called Quakers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey &amp; other
                    neighbouring Governments<br/>By their Representatives assembled at
                            <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName"">Philadelphia</a>
                        <a when=""1795-05-22"">5th. Mo. 22 1795</a><br/>To
                        our Brothers the <a href=""#shawnee"" class=""orgName"">Shawanese</a>, <a href=""#delaware"" class=""orgName"">Delawares</a>
                        <a href=""#wyandot"" class=""orgName"">Wyandots</a>, <a href=""#miami"" class=""orgName"">Miamis</a> &amp; other Nations of Indians<br/>who prepose
                            <del>holding</del> kindling a Counsil fire at  for
                        establishing<br/>peace between them &amp; the United
                    States.
                <p>Brothers<br/>When a time was agreed on <a when=""1793"">two years since</a>,
                    for kindling<br/>Council fire at <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandusky</a>,
                    our hearts were made to rejoice, in hope the<br/>good work of peace would go
                    forward; Six of our Brothers took a long journey<br/>to see <del/>you at that
                    time, under a desire of affording their assistance<br/>to make the Council fire
                    burn bright, but by the working of that bad Spirit<br/>which the
                    happiness of all Men, <del>that</del> the intended Treaty was frustrated, and
                        our<br/><del>said</del>friends were under the painful necessity of returning
                    home with the<br/>sorrowful tidings, that War, the sad destroyer of Mankind, was
                    likely to be<br/>continued; since which the accounts received from your Country
                    of as much<br/>Blood being shed <del>on both sides</del> have occasioned our
                    lamentation &amp; mourning.</p>
                <p>Brothers<br/>We then sent you an Address, <del>accompanied with a small present
                        <br/>as a Token of our Love and rememberance of you, which our said six
                        friends <br/>entrusted</del> wch way <del>committed</del> directed by our sd
                    6 Frnds <br/>to the care of <a href=""#cmcke1"" class=""persName"">Col. McKee</a>
                    <del/>but as we have <del/>had no<br/>information of your having received it, we
                    herewith send you a Copy. A<br/>small present, as a token of our love &amp; and
                    remembrance of you, was also sent by our Brethren abovement.<br/>which they had
                    not the satisfaction of delivering to you.</p>
                <p>Brothers<br/>It affords us much Comfort that a stop is so far put to the
                    further<br/>effusion of Blood, and we earnestly desire that in the Council
                    fire<br/>now about to be kindled, your trust &amp; dependance may be on the
                    Great<br/>over ruling Spirit of Peace &amp; Love, whereby he may be pleased so
                    to influence &amp; direct<br/>your Councils as that the sound of War may no more
                    be heard in your<br/>Land.</p>
                <p>Brothers<br/>We have often been grieved at beholding the sad effects
                        <del>eperienced by</del> produced in unguarded Men of whatever Nation from
                        <del>which</del><br/>the exessive use of strong drink <del>produce</del> and
                    particularly on the <del>Red</del> Indian people, even when<br/>deliberating on
                    the solemn Business of Treaties which are intended to bind them and<br/>their
                    posterity to future Generations, and are anxiously solicitous that <del>in
                        <br/>the present Treaty it may be</del> you may be weisly  determined
                    to take up a pious resolution to abstain-"new_Letterscopy.xml,new_Letterscopy.xml2,"from that evil practice.</p>
                <p>Brothers<br/>We continue <del/>sincerely desirous that your Trust
                    &amp; <del>Dependence</del> Confi-<br/>dence may be <del/> placed on
                    the Great &amp; Good Spirit, &amp; that by <del>a state of</del>
                    inward<br/>watchfulness &amp; <del>daily</del> prayer your kinds may become
                        <del>illuminated</del> enlightened more clearly to see<br/>the impropriety
                    of men shedding the Blood of their fellow men, thus might you<br/>gradually be
                    redeemed from that unjust &amp; revengeful Spirit from which
                        Wars<br/><del>originate</del> proceed.</p>
                <p>We much desire your further acquaintance with the <br/>
                    <del>precepts</del>pure &amp; peaceable Spirit of the Gospel,
                    and apprehend you would experience many benefits<br/>by having your Children
                    taught to read <del>and</del> write; or <del>in  interest and that
                        <br/>they might  instructed in our manner of</del> till<del/>ing the
                    Earth; <del>if you can <br/>devise any eligible Mode, wherein we 
                        particulars, <br/>we will cheerfully contribute towards your Aide &amp;
                        relief </del></p>
                <del><br/>may be generally promoted amongst your people --  --
                </del> as expressed in the<br/>abovement. Copy of our former Letter,
                    to which we refer <del/>and remain your<br/>Friends &amp; Brethren.
