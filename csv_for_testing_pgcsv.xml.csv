                <h1 type=""sub"">Of a tour to Detroit, in order to attend a

            <div type=""preface"">
                <p> In the second volume of Friends' Miscellany, was
                        published, <a href=""#jlind1"" class=""persName"">Jacob<br/> Lindley</a>'s Account of
                        a Journey to attend this Treaty, with preli<br/>minary remarks and a brief
                        history of the circumstances which led to<br/> this measure. The following
                        Journal, while it corroborates <a href=""#jlindl"" class=""persName"">Jacob<br/>
                            Lindley</a>'s account, presents a view of divers interesting
                        incidents<br/> and occurrences, not noted in that narrative. <a href=""#jmooor3"" class=""persName"">Joseph Moore</a> was a<br/> valuable friend and
                        minister belonging to Kingwood monthly meet-<br/>ing, New Jersey. The place of his residence was near <a href=""#flemi"" class=""placeName""> Flemington</a>.

                <p>I set out for Philadel-<br/>phia, and attended the
                    <a href=""#pymsufferings"" class=""orgName"">meeting for sufferings</a>, where<br/> were divers Friends who had given up to
                    attend the<br/> Indian treaty proposed to be held at <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandusky</a>, on<br/> the waters of <a href=""#lakee"" class=""geogName"">Lake
                        Erie</a> &#8212; having previously obtained <br/>certificates from our
                    several monthly meetings for<br/> that purpose. The commissioners appointed by

                <p>In the afternoon set out in company with "testing_pgcsv.xml,testing_pgcsv.xml_pg_1,"
                    <br/>

                    <a href=""#norrist"" class=""placeName"">Norristown </a>, where <a href=""#cpic"" class=""persName"">colonel Pickering</a> met us. Next<br/> day we proceeded to
                        <a href=""#Readi"" class=""placeName"">Reading</a> &#8212; thence to <a href=""#harrisb"" class=""placeName"">Harris-<br/>burgh</a> and over the <a href=""#broadm"" class=""geogName"">Broad Mountain</a>, <a href=""#mackin"" class=""placeName"">Mackinoy</a>, and<br/>
                    <a href=""#tuscar"" class=""placeName"">Tuscarora</a>, to <a href=""#sunb"" class=""placeName"">Sunbury</a> &#8212; thence crossed the <a href=""#susqueh"" class=""geogName"">Susque-<br/>hanna</a> at <a href=""#northu"" class=""placeName"">Northumberland</a>, a town standing in the<br/> point where the
                    east and west branches come toge-<br/>ther. Here, leaving the commissioners

                <p>
                   The forepart of this day, we
                    passed<br/> a rapid stream, called the <a href=""#loyalso"" class=""geogName"">Loyalsock</a> &#8212; and in the af-<br/>ternoon we crossed another large
                    stream, called <a href=""#lyc"" class=""geogName"">Ly-<br/>coming</a>, seven times &#8212;
                    lodged at <a href=""#jkyle1"" class=""persName"">James Kyle</a>'s. Next<br/> day rode
                    forty-three miles without any entertain-<br/>ment on the way, except what we had
                    with us. &#8212;<br/> Where we put up, there was no hay to be had for<br/> our horses,
                    so we fed them with oats, and tied them<br/> up for the night&#8212; went to bed, or
                    rather lay on the<br/> floor with our own blankets, in a very small house;<br/>
                    but rested well. In the morning, the weather was<br/> fine and pleasant &#8212; rode
                    to major <a href=""#slind"" class=""persName"">Samuel Lindley</a>'s,<br/> crossed the
                        <a href=""#tioga"" class=""geogName"">Tioga</a> twice, and the <a href=""#cowni"" class=""geogName"">Cownisky</a>; then to<br/> the <a href=""#ppost"" class=""placeName"">Painted Post</a>, crossing the <a href=""#cohoc"" class=""geogName"">Cohocton</a> at <a href=""#dfull"" class=""persName"">David<br/>
                    Fuller</a>'s. On our way here, we swam our horses<br/> over the
                        <a href=""#tioga"" class=""geogName"">Tioga</a>, and went ourselves in a canoe.
                    The<br/> country from <a href=""#northu"" class=""placeName"">Northumberland</a>to this
                    place, abounds<br/> with large streams of water, and abundance of flat<br/> land
                    on their banks, exceedingly rich. We observed<br/> in many places, old Indian
                    fields, with signs of the <br/>
                    "testing_pgcsv.xml,testing_pgcsv.xml_pg_2," old corn hills. On each side of these creeks and flats,<br/> are
                    ridges of mountains. We have now travelled ac-<br/>cording to the several
                    distances from place to place,<br/> two hundred, and forty-seven miles. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1797-05-09"">9th.</a><a href=""#willi"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                     Rode about thirty miles, and a little
                    be-<br/>fore night, got to an old Indian cabin, with fire in<br/>the middle,
                    where we lodged. We let our horses<br/> browse awhile in the woods, then fed
                    them with oats<br/> we had with us, and tied them up for the night. &#8212;<br/> This
                    cabin stands on the bank of the <a href=""#cohoc"" class=""geogName"">Cohocton</a> .
                    The<br/> roads here are new, and of course rough, which is<br/> trying to the
                    poor horses that are rid hard all day,<br/> and at night tied to a tree. Next
                    day, rode thirty-<br/> six miles to <a href=""#willi"" class=""placeName"">Williamsburgh</a>. Some parts of the road<br/> very rough. We
                    passed over some of the steepest<br/> hills I ever saw travelled. But the
                    country is new<br/> &#8212; and I have no doubt in a few years, the roads will<br/> be
                    much improved, as there is abundance of excel-<br/>lent land that is settling
                    fast in some places. Stayed<br/> this night at captain <a href=""#cwilm"" class=""persName"">Charles Williamson</a>'s, where we<br/> were kindly entertained.

                <p>
                     This morning the commissioners
                    despatch-<br/>ed a messenger to <a href=""#canan"" class=""placeName"">Canandaigua</a>
                    for an interpreter;<br/> so we rested here and were finely refreshed. Set<br/>
                    out again next day, and rode to <a href=""#gberr"" class=""persName"">Gilbert
                    Berry</a>'s, on<br/> the bank of the <a href=""#genes2"" class=""geogName"">Genesee
                        river</a>. Here we found<br/> about fifty Indians collected, amongst
                    whom were<br/> some of their chiefs; <a href=""#farme1"" class=""persName"">Farmer's
                        Brother</a>, <a href=""#redja1"" class=""persName"">Red Jacket</a>,<br/>
                    <a href=""#litbi1"" class=""persName"">Little Billy</a>, and others, to all of whom a
                    dinner<br/> was given by the commissioners. They expressed<br/> their gladness
                    in seeing us, and we also in seeing<br/> them. In the evening we had some
                    weighty con-<br/>versation together, wherein the commissioners im-<br/>parted a
                    little of their business concerning the treaty; <br/>
                    "testing_pgcsv.xml,testing_pgcsv.xml_pg_3," which appeared to give general satisfaction. After<br/> which, the
                    Indians gave our friend <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a> a<br/>
                    new name, which they in their language call Sutte-<br/>kutte, and signifies
                    plain or level. This name was<br/> given by <a href=""#farme1"" class=""persName"">Farmer's
                        Brother</a>, at which there was a<br/> small shout, in their way, and
                    they would have given<br/> us a song on the occasion; but understanding we
                    were<br/> a plain people, not accustomed to singing, it was<br/> omitted, and
                    nothing further followed than a little<br/> pleasantry. Near ten o'clock we all
                    retired and <br/> rested bravely. </p>

                <p> In the morning the Indians showed no inclination<br/> to depart while the
                    commissioners were here.<a href=""#redja1"" class=""persName"">Red<br/> Jacket</a> , at
                    the close of one of his speeches last even-<br/>ing, signified, that when he was
                    in Philadelphia, the<br/> white people had
                    proposed a method for them to<br/> turn buffaloes into cows, deer into sheep,
                    and bears<br/> into hogs; he thought it now a fit time for the
                    com-<br/>missioners to show them a piece of their skill; as<br/> they were now
                    on their way to <a href=""#canan"" class=""placeName"">Canandaigua</a> for<br/> some
                    clothing, &amp;c, and that a good buffalo would be<br/> very agreeable for
                    provision on the way. The com-<br/>missioners used some endeavours to obtain a
                    fat cow;<br/> but as there was none to be had here, they gave them<br/> a
                    quantity of salt beef, pork, and corn, at which they<br/> appeared satisfied.
                </p>

            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-05-14"">14th</a>.<a href=""#buffc1"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                     We prepared to move forward; divers
                    other<br/> people fell in company with us from <a href=""#schen"" class=""placeName"">Schenectady</a>
                    <br/>and other places, who were going into <a href=""#uppcanada"" class=""placeName"">Upper
                        Cana-<br/>da</a>. We swam our horses over the <a href=""#genes2"" class=""geogName"">Genesee river</a><br/> with some difficulty, and we,
                    with our baggage,<br/> crossed in a canoe. In the evening we put up in the<br/>
                    woods by the side of <a href=""#tonnec"" class=""geogName"">Tonnewanta creek</a>, where
                    we<br/> sheltered for the night with a good fire, and tied up <br/>
                    "testing_pgcsv.xml,testing_pgcsv.xml_pg_4," our horses as before. The following day we travel-<br/>led hard,
                    being very desirous to reach some house<br/> to lodge in. According to the
                    account given us, we<br/> rode about fifty miles, and truly we thought them<br/>
                    long enough. Arrived at <a href=""#buffc1"" class=""geogName"">Buffalo Creek</a> about
                    sun<br/> set, and put up at <a href=""#winney"" class=""persName"">landlord Winney</a>'s;
                    most of us<br/> lodged on the floor and slept well; also, had plenty<br/> of
                    grass for the horses. The country we have pass-<br/>ed through the last two
                    days, is Indian lands, and<br/> one continued wilderness. Much of the land
                    ap-<br/>pears very good, with a variety of timber, such as<br/> oak, hickory,
                    sugar maple, elm, ash, beech, linn,<br/> pine, cherry, butternut, &amp;c. </p>
