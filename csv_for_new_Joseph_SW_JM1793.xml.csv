                <p> In the second volume of Friends' Miscellany, was
                        published, <a href=""#jlind1"" class=""persName"">Jacob<br/> Lindley</a>'s Account of
                        a Journey to attend this Treaty, with preli<br/>minary remarks and a brief
                        history of the circumstances which led to<br/> this measure. The following
                        Journal, while it corroborates <a href=""#jlindl"" class=""persName"">Jacob<br/>
                            Lindley</a>'s account, presents a view of divers interesting
                        incidents<br/> and occurrences, not noted in that narrative. <a href=""#jmooor3"" class=""persName"">Joseph Moore</a> was a<br/> valuable friend and
                        minister belonging to Kingwood monthly meet-<br/>ing, New Jersey. The place of his residence was near <a href=""#flemi"" class=""placeName""> Flemington</a>.

                <p>I set out for Philadel-<br/>phia, and attended the
                    <a href=""#pymsufferings"" class=""orgName"">meeting for sufferings</a>, where<br/> were divers Friends who had given up to
                    attend the<br/> Indian treaty proposed to be held at <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandusky</a>, on<br/> the waters of <a href=""#lakee"" class=""geogName"">Lake
                        Erie</a> &#8212; having previously obtained <br/>certificates from our

                <p>In the afternoon set out in company with "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_1,"
                    <br/>

                    <a href=""#norrist"" class=""placeName"">Norristown </a>, where <a href=""#cpic"" class=""persName"">colonel Pickering</a> met us. Next<br/> day we proceeded to
                        <a href=""#Readi"" class=""placeName"">Reading</a> &#8212; thence to <a href=""#harrisb"" class=""placeName"">Harris-<br/>burgh</a> and over the <a href=""#broadm"" class=""geogName"">Broad Mountain</a>, <a href=""#mackin"" class=""placeName"">Mackinoy</a>, and<br/>
                    <a href=""#tuscar"" class=""placeName"">Tuscarora</a>, to <a href=""#sunb"" class=""placeName"">Sunbury</a> &#8212; thence crossed the <a href=""#susqueh"" class=""geogName"">Susque-<br/>hanna</a> at <a href=""#northu"" class=""placeName"">Northumberland</a>, a town standing in the<br/> point where the

                <p>
                   The forepart of this day, we
                    passed<br/> a rapid stream, called the <a href=""#loyalso"" class=""geogName"">Loyalsock</a> &#8212; and in the af-<br/>ternoon we crossed another large
                    stream, called <a href=""#lyc"" class=""geogName"">Ly-<br/>coming</a>, seven times &#8212;
                    lodged at <a href=""#jkyle1"" class=""persName"">James Kyle</a>'s. Next<br/> day rode
                    forty-three miles without any entertain-<br/>ment on the way, except what we had
                    with us. &#8212;<br/> Where we put up, there was no hay to be had for<br/> our horses,
                    so we fed them with oats, and tied them<br/> up for the night&#8212; went to bed, or
                    rather lay on the<br/> floor with our own blankets, in a very small house;<br/>
                    but rested well. In the morning, the weather was<br/> fine and pleasant &#8212; rode
                    to major <a href=""#slind"" class=""persName"">Samuel Lindley</a>'s,<br/> crossed the
                        <a href=""#tioga"" class=""geogName"">Tioga</a> twice, and the <a href=""#cowni"" class=""geogName"">Cownisky</a>; then to<br/> the <a href=""#ppost"" class=""placeName"">Painted Post</a>, crossing the <a href=""#cohoc"" class=""geogName"">Cohocton</a> at <a href=""#dfull"" class=""persName"">David<br/>
                    Fuller</a>'s. On our way here, we swam our horses<br/> over the
                        <a href=""#tioga"" class=""geogName"">Tioga</a>, and went ourselves in a canoe.
                    The<br/> country from <a href=""#northu"" class=""placeName"">Northumberland</a>to this
                    place, abounds<br/> with large streams of water, and abundance of flat<br/> land
                    on their banks, exceedingly rich. We observed<br/> in many places, old Indian
                    fields, with signs of the <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_2," old corn hills. On each side of these creeks and flats,<br/> are
                    ridges of mountains. We have now travelled ac-<br/>cording to the several
                    distances from place to place,<br/> two hundred, and forty-seven miles. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1797-05-09"">9th.</a><a href=""#willi"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                     Rode about thirty miles, and a little
                    be-<br/>fore night, got to an old Indian cabin, with fire in<br/>the middle,
                    where we lodged. We let our horses<br/> browse awhile in the woods, then fed
                    them with oats<br/> we had with us, and tied them up for the night. &#8212;<br/> This
                    cabin stands on the bank of the <a href=""#cohoc"" class=""geogName"">Cohocton</a> .
                    The<br/> roads here are new, and of course rough, which is<br/> trying to the
                    poor horses that are rid hard all day,<br/> and at night tied to a tree. Next
                    day, rode thirty-<br/> six miles to <a href=""#willi"" class=""placeName"">Williamsburgh</a>. Some parts of the road<br/> very rough. We
                    passed over some of the steepest<br/> hills I ever saw travelled. But the
                    country is new<br/> &#8212; and I have no doubt in a few years, the roads will<br/> be
                    much improved, as there is abundance of excel-<br/>lent land that is settling
                    fast in some places. Stayed<br/> this night at captain <a href=""#cwilm"" class=""persName"">Charles Williamson</a>'s, where we<br/> were kindly entertained.

            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-05-11"">11th.</a><a href=""#"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                     This morning the commissioners
                    despatch-<br/>ed a messenger to <a href=""#canan"" class=""placeName"">Canandaigua</a>
                    for an interpreter;<br/> so we rested here and were finely refreshed. Set<br/>
                    out again next day, and rode to <a href=""#gberr"" class=""persName"">Gilbert
                    Berry</a>'s, on<br/> the bank of the <a href=""#genes2"" class=""geogName"">Genesee
                        river</a>. Here we found<br/> about fifty Indians collected, amongst
                    whom were<br/> some of their chiefs; <a href=""#farme1"" class=""persName"">Farmer's
                        Brother</a>, <a href=""#redja1"" class=""persName"">Red Jacket</a>,<br/>
                    <a href=""#litbi1"" class=""persName"">Little Billy</a>, and others, to all of whom a
                    dinner<br/> was given by the commissioners. They expressed<br/> their gladness
                    in seeing us, and we also in seeing<br/> them. In the evening we had some
                    weighty con-<br/>versation together, wherein the commissioners im-<br/>parted a
                    little of their business concerning the treaty; <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_3," which appeared to give general satisfaction. After<br/> which, the
                    Indians gave our friend <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a> a<br/>
                    new name, which they in their language call Sutte-<br/>kutte, and signifies
                    plain or level. This name was<br/> given by <a href=""#farme1"" class=""persName"">Farmer's
                        Brother</a>, at which there was a<br/> small shout, in their way, and
                    they would have given<br/> us a song on the occasion; but understanding we
                    were<br/> a plain people, not accustomed to singing, it was<br/> omitted, and
                    nothing further followed than a little<br/> pleasantry. Near ten o'clock we all
                    retired and <br/> rested bravely. </p>

                <p> In the morning the Indians showed no inclination<br/> to depart while the
                    commissioners were here.<a href=""#redja1"" class=""persName"">Red<br/> Jacket</a> , at
                    the close of one of his speeches last even-<br/>ing, signified, that when he was
                    in Philadelphia, the<br/> white people had
                    proposed a method for them to<br/> turn buffaloes into cows, deer into sheep,
                    and bears<br/> into hogs; he thought it now a fit time for the
                    com-<br/>missioners to show them a piece of their skill; as<br/> they were now
                    on their way to <a href=""#canan"" class=""placeName"">Canandaigua</a> for<br/> some
                    clothing, &amp;c, and that a good buffalo would be<br/> very agreeable for
                    provision on the way. The com-<br/>missioners used some endeavours to obtain a
                    fat cow;<br/> but as there was none to be had here, they gave them<br/> a
                    quantity of salt beef, pork, and corn, at which they<br/> appeared satisfied.
                </p>

            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-05-14"">14th</a>.<a href=""#buffc1"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                     We prepared to move forward; divers
                    other<br/> people fell in company with us from <a href=""#schen"" class=""placeName"">Schenectady</a>
                    <br/>and other places, who were going into <a href=""#uppcanada"" class=""placeName"">Upper
                        Cana-<br/>da</a>. We swam our horses over the <a href=""#genes2"" class=""geogName"">Genesee river</a><br/> with some difficulty, and we,
                    with our baggage,<br/> crossed in a canoe. In the evening we put up in the<br/>
                    woods by the side of <a href=""#tonnec"" class=""geogName"">Tonnewanta creek</a>, where
                    we<br/> sheltered for the night with a good fire, and tied up <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_4," our horses as before. The following day we travel-<br/>led hard,
                    being very desirous to reach some house<br/> to lodge in. According to the
                    account given us, we<br/> rode about fifty miles, and truly we thought them<br/>
                    long enough. Arrived at <a href=""#buffc1"" class=""geogName"">Buffalo Creek</a> about
                    sun<br/> set, and put up at <a href=""#winney"" class=""persName"">landlord Winney</a>'s;
                    most of us<br/> lodged on the floor and slept well; also, had plenty<br/> of
                    grass for the horses. The country we have pass-<br/>ed through the last two
                    days, is Indian lands, and<br/> one continued wilderness. Much of the land
                    ap-<br/>pears very good, with a variety of timber, such as<br/> oak, hickory,
                    sugar maple, elm, ash, beech, linn,<br/> pine, cherry, butternut, &amp;c. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-05-16"">16th</a>. <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    Rode about three miles to the ferry,
                    nearly<br/> opposite <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName"">Fort Erie</a>, most of the
                    way along the beach<br/> of <a href=""#lakee"" class=""geogName"">Lake Erie</a>. Here
                    we crossed over the outlet of<br/> the lake, a large and strong current, landed
                    in the<br/>
                    <a href=""#brit"" class=""placeName"">British dominions</a>, and rode down the banks of
                    the<br/> river to <a href=""#cwils"" class=""persName"">Charles Willson</a>'s near the
                    <a href=""#niagf"" class=""geogName"">great falls</a>. The<br/> whole distance to this place is four hundred and<br/>
                    twenty-seven miles. In the evening, walked to<br/> the brow of the bank to view
                    the mighty cataract.<br/> Next morning went again, descended a very steep<br/>
                    hill and walked to the rock over which the water<br/>falls, which appears
                    tremendous indeed. There are<br/> rapids above the cataract that fall, it is
                    said, fifty feet<br/> (and it looks likely to be so) within the distance of<br/>
                    little more than half a mile. After satisfying our<br/> curiosity here, the
                    commissioners went on to <a href=""#gsim"" class=""persName"">gover-<br/>nor
                    Simcoe</a>'s, at <a href=""#nav"" class=""placeName"">Navy Hall</a>, sixteen
                    miles. This is<br/> nearly opposite the <a href=""#niafo"" class=""placeName"">garrison</a>, which stands on a point<br/>
                    of land in the United States. <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a>,<a href=""#jelli1"" class=""persName""> John<br/>
                        Elliott</a>, and myself, went about two miles to our <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_5," friend <a href=""#wlund1"" class=""persName"">William Lundy's</a>, where we
                    were kindly en-<br/>tertained, and spent most of the next day. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-05-19"">19th</a>. 
                <p>
                    Being first of the week, and having
                    appoint-<br/>ed a meeting to be held here at the eleventh hour;<br/> about the
                    time there attended a pretty large collection<br/> of people, more than the
                    house could contain. We<br/> thought it a favoured opportunity. After dinner
                    we<br/> had a solid opportunity with the family and divers<br/> friends who had
                    stayed with us. Then went about six<br/> miles to our friend <a href=""#jhill1"" class=""persName"">John Hill's</a>, who, with his wife,<br/> had been at
                    the meeting. Here we were kindly en-<br/>tertained and lodged. In the morning,
                    had a solid<br/> opportunity with the family, and set out for <a href=""#nav"" class=""placeName"">Navy<br/> Hall</a>, a messenger having been sent to invite
                    us to<br/> dine with the governor. He appears to be a plain<br/> man, and
                    remarkably easy of access. At table we<br/> had the company of the
                    commissioners, <a href=""#cbutl1"" class=""persName"">colonel But-<br/>ler</a>, <a href=""#mlit"" class=""persName"">majors Little</a>, <a href=""#hal"" class=""persName"">Hales</a>,
                    &amp;c. The governor, when<br/> we were walking in his garden, said our coming
                    for-<br/>ward at this time, did our society great honour. To-<br/>ward evening
                    we rode up the lake about two miles<br/> to <a href=""#peacock"" class=""persName"">landlord
                        Peacock</a>'s, and lodged. </p>

                <p>
                    We went up the lake twelve miles to
                        <a href=""#bpaul"" class=""persName"">Ben-<br/>jamin Paulin</a>'s and his brother
                        <a href=""#jpaul"" class=""persName"">Jesse</a>'s &#8212; our friend,<br/>
                    <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a>, having a letter from their
                    connexions in<br/>
                    Philadelphia. Here we were kindly
                    entertained. In<br/> the woods we came through, we observed the great-<br/>est
                    quantity of pigeons, I think I ever saw; they<br/> were flying up the lake,
                    being chiefly young ones,<br/> and very fat. The people take abundance of
                    them<br/> with clubs, poles, &amp;c. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-05-22"">22d</a>. 
                <p>
                    The weather has been warm and dry since<br/>
                    the time of our arrival in this country. I continue<br/> very poorly, but went
                    three miles to our friend <a href=""#jtayl2"" class=""persName"">John <br/>
                        "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_6," Taylor's,</a> though hardly able to travel. Here
                    we<br/> were kindly treated and lodged. I believe many<br/> were made glad in
                    seeing their friends come amongst<br/> them, for whom in their wilderness
                    situation, we<br/> often felt near sympathy. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-05-23"">23d</a>. <a href=""#short"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    I felt much better in health, and
                    understand-<br/>ing divers Friends live at a place called the <a href=""#short"" class=""geogName"">Short<br/> Hills</a>, about twelve miles off, we
                    concluded to go<br/> there. On the way we dined at <a href=""#trice1"" class=""persName"">Thomas
                        Rice</a>'s, and<br/> thence proceeded to <a href=""#jgilh1"" class=""persName"">Joshua Gillam</a>'s. We passed<br/> through some land where we saw
                    the effects of a<br/> hurricane that was on the 1st of the 7th month last,<br/>
                    and truly I may say, I never saw so great destruc-<br/>tion of timber. For about
                    two miles in width, and<br/> said to be many miles in length, there was scarce
                    a<br/> single tree left that was not torn up by the roots, or<br/> broken off.
                    This tract, as far as we have passed over,<br/> appears excellent land, with a
                    variety of good tim-<br/>ber &#8212; white and black oak, hickory, chestnut,
                    poplar,<br/> white pine, walnut, cherry, &amp;c. We, finding a few<br/> Friends
                    settled in this neighborhood, concluded to<br/> stay amongst them over
                    first-day, and have a meet-<br/>ing with them. In the interval, we visited at
                        <a href=""#jcraw1"" class=""persName"">James<br/> Crawford</a>'s, <a href=""#esnig1"" class=""persName"">Enoch Scrigley</a>'s, and <a href=""#jdor"" class=""persName"">John
                        Dorlin</a>g's,<br/> where the meeting is proposed to be held. </p>

            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-05-26"">26th</a>. <a href=""#nav"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    We had a considerable gathering of
                    people<br/> that behaved orderly, among whom we had a satis-<br/>factory
                    opportunity. In the afternoon, set out on<br/> our way to <a href=""#nav"" class=""placeName"">Navy Hall</a> , and lodged at <a href=""#jmoor2"" class=""persName"">Jeremiah<br/>
                        Moore</a>'s. Having heard of the arrival of the other<br/> Friends
                    that came by the way of <a href=""#alban'"" class=""placeName"">Albany</a>, we rose<br/>
                    early next morning, and went to our friend <a href=""#bhill1"" class=""persName"">Benja-<br/>min
                        Hill</a>'s, where we took breakfast &#8212; then rode to<br/> the landing,
                    and thence to <a href=""#nav"" class=""placeName""> Navy Hall</a>. Spent a little
                        <br/>"new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_7," time at the governor's, and went back to the
                    landing,<br/> where we met with <a href=""#jlind1"" class=""persName"">Jacob Lindley</a>,
                        <a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName"">William Savery</a>,<br/> and <a href=""#whart"" class=""persName"">William Hartshorne</a>, who had come on by wa-<br/>ter.
                    Our stores were landed here, and we all dined<br/> at <a href=""#csmith"" class=""persName"">captain Smith</a>'s, at the mess house. In the after-<br/>noon we
                    set up our tents on the hill, and lodged all<br/> together. This seemed very
                    pleasant, being all in<br/> health, and they having had a favourable passage from<br/>
                     New York to this place, and very agreeable
                    compa-<br/>ny with <a href=""#genlinc"" class=""persName"">general Lincoln</a>, in their
                    covered batteaux ,<br/> two of which they propose taking up to
                        <a href=""#lakee"" class=""geogName"">Lake Erie</a>. </p>

                <p>
                    Having had a good night's rest in our
                    tents,<br/> were in the morning all bravely. When we shall<br/> move forward
                    from this place appears at present un-<br/>certain, as the commissioners sent
                    off an express yes-<br/>terday to <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName"">Philadelphia</a> on some important occasion,<br/> and expect to
                    wait his return. Young <a href=""#habee1"" class=""persName"">Cornplanter</a><br/> went
                    some days ago to his father's, about one hun-<br/>dred and fifty miles from this
                    place. The Indians,<br/> we understand, are gathering from many parts to
                    the<br/> place appointed. Some of the <a href=""#Mohawk"" class=""orgName"">Mohawks</a> are now<br/> here. We shortly
                    expect a number of the <a href=""#fvntns"" class=""orgName"">Five Na-<br/>tions</a>.
                        <a href=""#jlind1"" class=""persName"">Jacob Lindley</a> being desirous to see
                        <a href=""#jmoor2"" class=""persName"">Jeremiah<br/> Moore</a>, we two rode there,
                    spent the afternoon, and<br/> lodged. The weather cool and cloudy, with
                    east-<br/>erly winds. The next day was rainy. We are now<br/> within about three
                    miles of the great cataract &#8212; the<br/> noise of which is much like the roaring
                    of the sea in<br/> time of storm. The people gave us a particular ac-<br/>count
                    of their distressed situation, about four years<br/> ago, for want of bread, and
                    their loss of cattle and<br/> horses; which was truly alarming ; but through
                    the<br/> goodness of kind Providence, they have now plenty <br/>"new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_8," of
                    bread and other necessaries; and plenty of good<br/> sugar which they make from
                    the maple tree. </p>

                    <a href=""#jelli1"" class=""persName"">John
                        Elliott</a> came up from our camp at the<br/> landing, and we, with
                        <a href=""#jmoor2"" class=""persName"">Jeremiah Moore</a> and <a href=""#bhill1"" class=""persName"">Benjamin<br/> Hill</a>, went to the <a href=""#niagf"" class=""geogName"">Falls,</a> where <a href=""#jlind1"" class=""persName"">Jacob</a> had not been,<br/> and viewed them in a
                    different direction from what<br/> we had done before. In this as well as many
                    other<br/> things, the mighty works of Providence are emi-<br/>nently displayed,
                    being far beyond the power of hu-<br/>man art to form. Some of our company
                    descended<br/> the mighty hill, by the clefts of rocks and the help<br/> of
                    Indian ladders, to the water below, supposed one<br/> hundred and ten feet. Here
                    they saw divers curi-<br/>osities, and brought up some memorials of stone,<br/>
                    bones, &amp;c. We then returned to our camp, and I<br/> lodged at <a href=""#bcanb1"" class=""persName"">Benjamin Canby</a>'s. </p>

                    The weather wet and little

                    consumption &#8212; we being all in pretty good<br/> health, and for the most part a
                    number of Indians and<br/> others at our camp. The commissioners are most
                    of<br/> the time at <a href=""#nav"" class=""placeName"">Navy Hall</a> with <a href=""#gsim"" class=""persName"">governor

                    <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName""> Fort Erie</a>, to take passage in a vessel for

                    likely to go from this under<br/> a week or ten days. We endeavour to fill up
                    our<br/> time in seeing our friends. This afternoon <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John

                    and first of the week, we held a meeting
                    about <br/>four miles from the landing, in a large barn, of which<br/> previous
                    notice had been given. The collection was<br/> large, and proved a solid
                    opportunity. I hope it<br/> tended to the advancement of our religious
                    testimo-<br/>ny. Divers Friends came many miles to attend it.<br/> After which,
                        <a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName"">William Savery </a>and <a href=""#whart"" class=""persName"">
                        William Harts-<br/>horne</a> returned to our camp, in order to send

                    dined &#8212; thence to <a href=""#wlund1"" class=""persName"">William Lundy</a>'s and lodged.
                        <a href=""#eburc1"" class=""persName"">Es-<br/>quire Burch</a> was at meeting, and

                    relation of mine. <a href=""#bwill1"" class=""persName"">Benjamin</a> went with us six
                    miles<br/> to the Fort. Here are the king's stores, and a har-<br/>bour for
                    shipping &#8212; several topsail vessels were then<br/> lying here. We went on board
                    the Dunmore, <a href=""#cford1"" class=""persName"">cap-<br/>tain Ford</a>, bound to
                        <a href=""#detro"" class=""placeName"">Detroit</a>. The cabin passengers<br/>
                    besides ourselves were <a href=""#rinn1"" class=""persName""> Robert Inne</a>,

                    marines(be<br/>ing a king's ship) and about sixty Indians of four<br/> different
                    tribes bound to the treaty, made our whole<br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_10," crew about ninety. We left our horses in the care<br/> of
                        <a href=""#bwill1"" class=""persName"">Benjamin Willson</a> &#8212; next day set sail and
                    steered<br/> up the lake. We had fine pleasant weather until the<br/> 8th, when
                    being near the islands towards the head <br/>of the lake, and dark night coming
                    on us, we stood<br/> off and on till morning &#8212; had several squalls of rain,<br/>
                    and short blasts of high wind, with thunder and<br/> lightning &#8212; which was
                    somewhat alarming, as our<br/> ship had on board a large quantity of powder.
                    But<br/> through the goodness of kind Providence we were<br/> preserved from
                    damage. </p>

                    This day we had a small meeting in the<br/> cabin with our fellow passengers and
                    two Indian<br/> chiefs. In the evening entered the mouth of <a href=""#detro"" class=""geogName""> Detriot<br/> river</a>, and anchored till morning; when
                    we ran up<br/> the beautiful river a northerly course, with a fair<br/> wind to
                        <a href=""#detro"" class=""placeName"">Detroit</a>. This is a small garrison town,
                    with<br/> a variety of inhabitants. Here is much of the sound<br/> of drums and

                    our ship, were<br/> very respectful to us &#8212; and there was great harmony<br/>
                    amongst ourselves. Thanks be to kind Providence<br/> for all his unmerited
                    favours. Here we landed our<br/> small baggage, and took lodgings at <a href=""#mdols"" class=""persName"">Matthew Dol-<br/>son's</a> for the present. </p>

                    Found our accommodations comfortable
                    and<br/> easy. We visited the commandant,<a href=""#cengl1"" class=""persName"">colonel
                        Eng-<br/>land</a>, and showed him our passport from <a href=""#gsim"" class=""persName"">governor <br/> Simcoe</a>, at <a href=""#niaga"" class=""placeName"">Niagara</a>, and are now waiting the com-<br/>missioners coming
                    forward, which we hope may be<br/> soon. From the present complexion of things,
                    it<br/> looks likely to be some time before the treaty com-<br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_11,"mences; so that we find patience very necessary to<br/> be
                    exercised. We hear many sentiments expressed,<br/> some favourable and some
                    otherwise. Hope our<br/> minds may not be diverted by either from that
                    hum-<br/>ble dependence on the omnipotent Arm of power,<br/> under whose banner,

                    Took a walk down the bank of the
                    river,<br/> about three miles to a fine spring, of which there<br/> are few
                    hereabouts. The inhabitants mostly use the<br/> river water, which is said to be
                    very wholesome.<br/> The banks of this river for many miles above and<br/> below
                    the town, are very thickly settled, mostly<br/> with French, who have fine
                    orchards and meadows,<br/> and good wheat growing. Their grain is mostly<br/>
                    manufactured by wind-mills, of which there are<br/> many in sight. The
                    inhabitants of the town are as<br/> great a mixture, I think, as I ever knew in
                    any one<br/> place. English, Scotch, Irish, Dutch, French, Ame-<br/>ricans from
                    different states, with black and yellow,<br/> and seldom clear of Indians of
                    different tribes in the<br/> day time. These are all turned out by nine
                    o'clock<br/> at night, and the gates are shut &#8212; sentries are placed<br/>
                    constantly in various parts round tire town, which is <br/>enclosed with high
                    pickets. There is no place of wor-<br/>ship except one <a href=""#catholic"" class=""orgName"">Roman Catholic</a> chapel. There are<br/> large
                    ships employed on these waters, some of which<br/> are from one hundred to one
                    hundred and fifty tons<br/> burden; they sail up to <a href=""#michi"" class=""placeName"">Michillimackinac</a>, several<br/> hundred miles from this place,
                    and return with<br/> abundance of peltry &#8212; the staple commodity of this<br/>
                    country. </p>

                    Took passage in a small boat, bound up
                    the<br/> river <a href=""#latr"" class=""geogName"">Latrench</a>, on the east side of
                        <a href=""#lstc"" class=""geogName"">Lake St. Clair,</a>
                    <br/> with a fair wind &#8212; passed through the lake, more than<br/> twenty miles
                    over, and went up the river about fif-<br/>teen miles, to <a href=""#idols"" class=""persName"">Isaac Dolson</a>'s, where we lodged. &#8212;<br/> Next day, with some
                    Indians in a canoe, proceed-<br/>ed up the river about twenty miles, to
                        <a href=""#edwa1"" class=""persName"">Edward<br/> Watson</a>'s, son of <a href=""#twat1"" class=""persName"">Thomas</a>, of New
                        York<br/>, an intimate<br/> acquaintance. The respect I felt for him
                    and his<br/> connections induced me to take this tour to see him,<br/> and know
                    how he fared here. He and his wife re-<br/>ceived me kindly. They are connected
                    with the<br/> <a href=""#moravian"" class=""orgName"">Moravian brethren</a>, and were very civil to me. <a href=""#jheck1"" class=""persName"">John <br/>Heckewelder</a>, Indian interpreter and
                    Moravian
                    <br/>minister, was passenger with me as far as <a href=""#dols1"" class=""persName"">Dolson</a>'s,<br/> where he took horse and went up the river to
                    visit<br/> his brethren at a settlement of that people. This<br/> appears to be
                    a beautiful new country, just settling;<br/> fine wheat, corn, peas, &amp;c. now
                    growing, and grass<br/> in abundance; &#8212; the timber, white and black oak,<br/>

                    informed it continues in that way<br/> for one hundred and fifty miles up this
                    river &#8212; the<br/> the general course of which runs about east from its<br/>
                    mouth, and the farther up, it is said, the better the<br/> land. The inhabitants
                    here appear to want as much<br/> cultivation as the lands they live on. May the
                    Lord's<br/> power so reach their hearts, as to bring them into<br/> subjection
                    to his Divine will. </p>

                        <br/>"new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_13," where divers were collected, being much accustom-<br/>ed

                    Went early into the town &#8212; found all

                    not yet come forward; so that<br/> we are here in suspense with respect to the

                    about the conduct of the Indians; but we en-<br/>deavour to keep our minds
                    quiet, trusting in the<br/> arm of divine power for preservation, and

                    all<br/> well. We have frequently been visited by num-<br/>bers of the Indian

                    <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandusky</a>, who mostly called us Shemucteman,

                    readily did, by putting<br/> the instrument to the mouth, and sometimes to
                    the<br/> nose; as handily to the one as the other.</p>

                <p> This evening had the company of <a href=""#cdrak1"" class=""persName"">capt. John
                        Drake</a>,<br/> a coaster between this and <a href=""#macki"" class=""placeName"">Mackinaw</a>, distant one<br/> hundred and thirty leagues &#8212; sails
                    in a sloop of se-<br/>venty or eighty tons burthen. He gave us some<br/> account
                    of the north-west fur trade, and the man-<br/>ner of its being carried on by the
                    companies con-<br/>cerned, who employ many hundred men, that stay<br/> many
                    years in the country, travelling and trading<br/> with the northern Indians for
                    peltry; an abundance<br/> of which, of the richest kind, is brought from
                    the<br/> high northern latitudes, which nets the companies<br/> very large
                    profit. But among what people, or in<br/> what part of the world, except the
                        <a href=""#canfre"" class=""orgName"">Canadian French</a>,<br/> could persons be found
                    for their purpose, I know<br/> not. They are allowed a very small portion
                    of<br/> provisions from this to the <a href=""#grandp"" class=""placeName"">Grand
                        Portage</a>, at the<br/> head of <a href=""#lakes"" class=""geogName"">Lake
                        Superior</a>, which is about eight hun-<br/>dred miles; there they
                    are allowed about one bushel<br/> (forty-two quarts French measure) of Indian
                    corn<br/> per man, for a year, and a little fat, which they<br/> may use at
                    their own discretion. The corn is pre-<br/>pared in a curious manner at
                        <a href=""#detro"" class=""placeName""> Detroit</a>, being first<br/> boiled in
                    strong lye, which takes off the outside<br/> hull; afterwards it is spread out
                    and dried, then<br/> packed up for use. With this they set out, and re-<br/>
                    turn not until the end of the year, when a fresh <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_17," supply of goods is taken up with canoes, &amp;c. by<br/> many
                    hundred men to the <a href=""#grandp"" class=""placeName"">Portage</a>, where they
                    ex-<br/>change commodities to a very great amount. Thus<br/> goes on the trade
                    from year to year. The men in<br/> the north live principally on fish, and the
                    flesh of<br/> beasts of divers kinds, without bread or salt, and<br/> when they
                    return appear as robust and healthy, and<br/> even more so than those who live
                    on the greatest<br/> delicacies. The principal fish in <a href=""#lakes"" class=""geogName"">Lake Superior</a> are<br/> the white fish and salmon trout, which
                    are fine<br/> and delicate: we have eat of them, brought fresh from<br/> the
                    lake to this place in six days. </p>
                <p> We understand one <a href=""#mkenz1"" class=""persName"">M'Kenzie</a> is now out
                    with<br/> ten men, exploring the <a href=""#northw"" class=""placeName""> North-west
                        Territory</a> : he<br/> once attempted it before; was out more than
                    a year,<br/> and discovered large frozen waters in the north, but,<br/> whether
                    lakes or ocean, he knew not &#8212; supposed the<br/> latter, the water being salt. </p>

                <p>
                    <a href=""#cdrak1"" class=""persName"">Captain Drake</a>, by his own account, had been
                    se-<br/>veral voyages to <a href=""#afri"" class=""placeName"">Africa</a>, in the horrid
                    business of <br/>fetching slaves, which he now very much condemns.<br/> He told
                    us many curious tales; &#8212; and is certainly<br/> a very temperate man with respect
                    to drink, taking<br/> nothing but water &#8212; a rare instance in a seafaring<br/>
                    man. Happy would it be for many thousands in<br/> the world, were his example
                    followed in that re-<br/>spect; families would be preserved from ruin and<br/>
                    distress, morality increase, the poor Indians be<br/> saved from many acts of
                    violence, and the end of<br/> our creation be more fully answered by
                    honouring<br/> God, our Creator. </p>

                    We are frequently visited by the officers
                    of<br/> this place, both civil and military, who appear<br/> friendly, and treat
                    us with much respect, often <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_18," wishing us success in our laudable undertaking; as-<br/>suring us,
                    that nothing should be wanting that lay<br/> in their power, to render us happy
                    and comfortable.<br/> The commandant said, that if he apprehended dan-<br/>ger
                    at any time, he should lay his commands on us<br/> not to depart the place. But,
                    although we sought<br/> not the protection of military power, we were not<br/>
                    insensible of his great good will towards us, which<br/> we were not wanting to
                    acknowledge. </p>

                <p> Visits from the Indians are almost every day re-<br/>peated, by different tribes
                    constantly coming in,<br/>, this being the thoroughfare for all the northern
                    In-<br/>dians. It would be difficult to describe the various<br/> appearances
                    they make, and languages they speak.<br/> It is wonderful to find the vast
                    expense the <a href=""#brit"" class=""orgName"">British<br/> government</a> is at with
                    this people. <a href=""#gsim1"" class=""persName"">Governor Sim-<br/>coe</a> said it cost
                    them thirty thousand pounds per an-<br/>num. Here are agents appointed, that are
                    daily<br/> giving out large quantities of provision, &amp;c. </p>

                <p>
                    This day had a visit from a <a href=""#wyandot"" class=""orgName"">Wyandot</a> chief,<br/> who
                    appeared to have much concern respecting the<br/> approaching treaty, and
                    mentioned the remem-<br/>brance of some long and broad belts that were
                    given<br/> out in former treaties, intended to bind us by the<br/> hands and
                    arms, so that no small accident in future<br/> should be able to make a
                    separation; and, notwith-<br/>standing all that had happened, they (<a href=""#wyandot"" class=""orgName"">the
                        Wyan-<br/>dots</a>) felt some of the old affection to remain, and he<br/> hoped we
                    would find it so at the general council;<br/> but could speak for none but
                    themselves. We as-<br/>sured him we had the same love and friendship for<br/>
                    them and all others, as our forefathers had, and that<br/> our principles had
                    always restrained us from war;<br/> and when we believed the government was
                    disposed <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_19," to make peace with them on principles of justice,<br/> we were
                    made willing to leave our homes and take<br/> this long journey to endeavour to
                    promote it, and<br/> to be present at the concluding of so good a work.<br/> He
                    said, he knew long ago, we did not fight, but<br/> were for peace, and that, as
                    we had come a long<br/> journey, preserved in health, it was evident the<br/>
                    Great Spirit was pleased with our coming, and he<br/> hoped some good would be
                    done, and that the<br/> Great Spirit would bring us home in health and<br/>
                    safety. </p>

                <p> We had a visit also this morning from <a href=""#Ab"" class=""persName"">Abram</a>,
                    an<br/> Indian chief, <a href=""#katha"" class=""persName"">Katharine</a> his wife, and
                    their daugh-<br/>ters, richly clad, with plates of silver, &amp;c. </p>

                <p> The introduction of distilled spirits among the<br/> people appears to have been
                    their ruin. The frauds,<br/> in consequence of it, imposed upon them, taking
                    in<br/> the ravages and depredations of war made amongst<br/> themselves, with
                    multiplied murders and thefts,<br/> seems to have prevented their being a
                    wealthy peo-<br/>ple. The contrary with many is sorrowfully their <br/>
                    situation, I fear to our condemnation; yet the his-<br/>tory of Indian
                    barbarity, and breach of faith to<br/> white people, and to one another, which
                    we have<br/> heard related since we came here, would be shock-<br/>ing to
                    recite, and is almost at times ready to stagger<br/> the faith of their best
                    friends. One of the <a href=""#moravian"" class=""orgName"">Moravian<br/> missionaries</a> signified his sense, that if peace
                    should<br/> be concluded, it would not last long, until they were<br/> further
                    chastised. <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a> asked, by what<br/>
                    means? Did he mean the sword? He was answered,<br/> yes. This sentiment, from
                    one of those who make<br/> profession of the peaceable principles of the
                    gospel,<br/> was really discouraging. </p>


                "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_20,"
                <p> We often hear many frightful things suggested; as,<br/> that we shall be either
                    killed, or kept as hostages at<br/> the ensuing council. This, with the accounts
                    of the<br/> Indian warriors in time past, frequently passing with<br/> numbers
                    of scalps and their disconsolate prisoners,<br/> seemed dreadful; yet we are not
                    discouraged from<br/> pursuing our first prospect; believing he that put us<br/>
                    forth, will go before us, if we are not wanting on our<br/> part. </p>

                <p> It must be said to the honour of British humani-<br/>ty, and in commendation of
                    this government of Up-<br/>per <a href=""#canad"" class=""placeName"">Canada</a>, and
                    its truly respectable and generous<br/> officers, that they have interfered to
                    the relief of<br/> great numbers of persons, and obtained their redemp-<br/>tion
                    at a great price; divers of whom that we met<br/> with appeared as the outcasts
                    of <a href=""#euro"" class=""placeName"">Europe</a> ; some of<br/> them, as <a href=""#cengl1"" class=""persName"">colonel

                    gratitude to acknowledge<br/> the kindness, though in some instances it cost
                    one<br/> hundred pounds. But in the case of a real Ameri-<br/>can, they never
                    grudged it. </p>

                    First of the week. This morning we
                    were<br/> visited by a principal man of the <a href=""#wyandot"" class=""orgName"">Wyandots</a>, called<br/> the <a href=""#bchie1"" class=""persName"">Blind Chief</a>, with his nephew, grand, and great<br/> grandson;
                    with whom we had some friendly con-<br/>versation. He told us eight of their
                    principal men<br/> were gone on to the council. We held meetings<br/> fore and
                    afternoon in the king's sail loft, to a good<br/> degree of satisfaction; being
                    largely attended by the<br/> citizens, officers, and soldiers, who behaved

                    Yesterday arrived the ship Ottoway,<a href=""#ccow"" class=""persName""> captain<br/> Cowan</a> , from <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName"">Fort
                        Erie</a>. He brought about eighty<br/> Indians &#8212; more than sixty
                    were landed at <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""geogName"">Mia-<br/>mi rapids</a>, with
                        <a href=""#cbutl1"" class=""persName"">colonel Butler</a>; eighteen of the <a href=""#oneida"" class=""orgName"">Onei-<br/>das</a> were on board here. It

                    hurt by some other Indians<br/> that were there, on account of some dislike they
                    had<br/> to one of their chiefs, who had given his interest in<br/> favour of
                    the Americans, in such a manner as to cre-<br/>ate jealousies amongst them.
                    They, notwithstand-<br/>ing apprehend themselves quite safe in the British<br/>
                    lines, where the tribes of all the nations from east,<br/> west, north, and
                    south, are daily supplied with pro-<br/>visions, &amp;c. And we hear nothing but
                    wishes for <br/> peace among the people every where.</p>

                <p> This day we crossed the river in our landlord's<br/> boat, with himself, wife,
                    &amp;c. to his farm, where we<br/> regaled ourselves with fine ripe cherries,
                    and to-<br/>wards evening returned. The weather very warm,<br/> and for many
                    days past it has been very wet &#8212; but<br/> through divine favour we are all

                    We had a visit from <a href=""#cengl1"" class=""persName"">colonel England</a>, who is<br/> constantly manifesting his regard
                    in a very respect-<br/>ful manner. He invited us to walk with him to his<br/>
                    garden, and some of our company went. We had<br/> also the company, at our
                    lodgings, of a young <a href=""#shawnee"" class=""orgName"">Shaw-<br/>neese</a> chief,
                    neatly and richly dressed in Indian<br/> style; he stayed and dined with us,

                    I was this day very poorly with a

                    We are much confined within the narrow<br/>

                    there is a want of air. A fa-<br/>vourable opportunity presenting for a small
                    tour on<br/> the water, we, except <a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName"">William
                        Savery</a> and <a href=""#whart"" class=""persName"">William<br/>
                        Hartshorne</a>, went in a boat, provided by our friend<br/>
                    <a href=""#wbak1"" class=""persName"">William Baker</a>, up the river about nine miles, to<br/>
                    <a href=""#nwill1"" class=""persName"">Nathan Williams</a>'s, where we were kindly
                    received,<br/> and dined. His place is situate at the entrance of<br/><a href=""#lakst"" class=""geogName""> Lake St. Clair</a>. While here, Nathan gave us an
                    ac-<br/>count, that in digging a cave for a root house, they<br/> found, about
                    six feet below the surface of the<br/> ground, large quantities of human bones,
                    that must<br/> have been for a long time there: and at another<br/> place on the
                    bank of the lake, it being washed away<br/> when the lake was high, there were
                    seen great<br/> numbers of the same kind, which they gathered up<br/> and
                    buried. The Indians said they must have been <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_23," from people a great while ago that they knew no-<br/>thing of.
                    There is also near this lake, as we are in-<br/>formed, the appearance of old
                    forts, curiously made<br/> in ancient time, where pieces of earthenware are<br/>
                    often found, though large trees are now standing in<br/> the entrenchments, of
                    which the present Indians<br/> can give no account. We seem pretty generally
                    led<br/> to believe, from various circumstances, that the na-<br/>tives of this
                    land must be the descendants of old<br/> Jacob, and are of the scattered tribes,
                    who probably<br/> found their way here through <a href=""#rus"" class=""placeName"">Russia</a>, and crossed<br/> over the narrow strait from <a href=""#kams"" class=""placeName"">Kamschatka</a> to the west<br/> side of America. Be all
                    this as it may, we find them<br/> here in great numbers, at present a savage,
                    barbarous<br/> people when at war, and more particularly when in-<br/>toxicated
                    with strong drink, which has been intro-<br/>duced by the white people that
                    suppose themselves<br/> by far their superiors in religious and natural
                    under-<br/>standing. Happy would it have been for them and<br/> us, had we used
                    those superior talents, in mercy<br/> conferred upon us, more to the honour of
                    God, by<br/> following the example of our holy leader, Christ<br/> Jesus, who
                    said he came not to destroy men's lives,<br/> but to save them. May all
                    Christendom more and<br/> more labour to experience a renovation of heart
                    and<br/> mind, submitting and conforming to the will of hea-<br/>ven in all our
                    conduct, consistent with the design of<br/> our creation. Then might we have
                    reason to hope<br/> for a blessing on our labours, tending to stop the<br/>
                    effusion of human blood, and the establishment of<br/> Christ's kingdom on the
                    mountain of love and holi-<br/>ness, where the lion and the lamb might lie
                    down<br/> together, there being nothing to make us afraid.<br/> In the afternoon
                    we re-embarked and returned to <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_24," town. <a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName"">Wm. Savery</a> and <a href=""#whart"" class=""persName"">Wm. Hartshorne</a> in our<br/> absence, were visited by a
                    <a href=""#shawnee"" class=""orgName"">Shawnese</a> warrior,
                    who<br/> announced to them what had frequently been sug-<br/>gested to us
                    before, by divers persons, that if the<br/> commissioners did not immediately
                    agree that all<br/> the land west of the <a href=""#ohior"" class=""geogName"">Ohio</a>
                    should be given up by the<br/> <a href=""#usa"" class=""placeName"">United States</a>, or even hinted any thing to the
                    con-<br/>trary, by offering gifts or money as purchase, that<br/> not one of
                    them or their company would go off the<br/> ground alive; for their fathers, who
                    were all gone,<br/> had sold lands for knives, rum, &amp;c. till they were<br/>
                    now driven almost to the sun setting, where they<br/> were determined to make a
                    stand. He also pointed<br/> out very sensibly, the sad effects strong drink
                    had<br/> on their fathers in general. He then appeared per-<br/>fectly sober &#8212;
                    informing that four days before he left<br/> the <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""geogName"">Miami
                        Rapids</a>, a deputation of two chiefs from<br/> a tribe, embarked
                    for <a href=""#niagf"" class=""placeName"">Niagara</a> to meet the commis-<br/>sioners,
                    and let them know the outlines of their con-<br/>clusions; and that if the white
                    people would settle<br/> to the banks of the <a href=""#ohior"" class=""geogName"">Ohio</a> on the east side, and agree<br/> that the river should be
                    the line, they would be glad,<br/> and take them by the hand and call them
                    brothers.<br/> But we apprehended no such power lay with the<br/> commissioners,
                    nor of its being the design of govern-<br/>ment, &#8212; the cloud looked dark and
                    heavy, and por-<br/>tended some dreadful scenes of desolation, except<br/> the
                    Lord should be pleased, in his abundant mercy,<br/> to interpose and spare this
                    wicked generation. </p>

                <p> The aforesaid Indian, notwithstanding his sensi-<br/>bility and calmness, about
                    two hours after, returned<br/> much intoxicated with rum &#8212; behaved very
                    rudely,<br/> and drew a stroke with his tomahawk at one <a href=""#sash1"" class=""persName"">Sylves-<br/>ter Ash</a>, an interpreter, who had long resided with <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_25," the <a href=""#shawnee"" class=""orgName"">Shawnese</a>, and now lives at
                        <a href=""#fpitt1"" class=""placeName"">Fort Pitt</a>. We sup-<br/>posed he had a
                    grudge against him for leaving them;<br/> but <a href=""#sash1"" class=""persName"">Ash</a> prevented his doing him mischief. This,<br/> with other
                    insolent behavior to our landlord, caused<br/>
                    <a href=""#cmuns1"" class=""persName"">captain Munsey</a>, who was there, to send for
                    some<br/> soldiers to turn him out of the garrison. These<br/> things look
                    gloomy, and tend to confirm us that no-<br/>thing short of wisdom from above
                    will do for us to<br/> lean to. </p>

                    First of the week. We held a meeting in<br/>
                    the forenoon in the old sail loft: it was to good satis-<br/>faction, being
                    large and solid. In the afternoon we<br/> went about five miles to the <a href=""#rushr"" class=""geogName"">river Rushe</a> &#8212; held a<br/> meeting with the
                    inhabitants there and several who<br/> went with us from the town. This also we

                    The weather hot and sultry &#8212; a heavy
                    thun-<br/>der shower. We have no account from the commis-<br/>sioners &#8212; hope
                    they may come on with the Indian<br/> deputies, if any thing is likely to be
                    done. This is<br/> truly a trying scene to us, to be kept in this
                    expen-<br/>sive place so long in suspense; yet hope it may not<br/> be
                    altogether in vain. We think we have done the <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_26," best we could in our present circumstances. Various<br/> reports
                    are daily coming in, with respect to the In-<br/>dians' disposition. We much
                    desire an opportunity<br/> with them in council, if it could be come at
                    proper-<br/>ly, whether the commissioners come or not. The<br/> opinion of many
                    is, there will be no general treaty.<br/> We received a letter from <a href=""#cmkee1"" class=""persName"">colonel M'Kee</a> in answer<br/> to one written him some
                    time ago; &#8212; says he will at-<br/>tend to our request, and give us every
                    intelligence<br/> he apprehends necessary; &#8212; and yesterday, one from<br/>
                    <a href=""#haupa1"" class=""persName"">captain Hendricks</a>, at the <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""geogName"">rapids of  Miami</a>, request-<br/>ing some favours from us, &#8212;
                    which were granted.<br/> And truly we have many requests, that in our
                    pre-<br/>sent circumstances we are not able to comply with<br/> to the full.
                        <a href=""#haupa1"" class=""persName"">Hendrick</a>s' account is more favourable<br/>
                    than some others we have had. He expresses a<br/> hope there will be a peace.
                    The general cry among<br/> the gentlemen and more knowing inhabitants of
                    this<br/> place is, for God's sake, gentlemen, don't venture<br/> yourselves to
                        <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandusky</a>. This we believe is from<br/>
                    motives of entire friendship and good will to us,<br/> and makes it at times
                    very trying. And though we<br/> have not felt any slavish fears &#8212; yet hope to
                    move<br/> cautiously, as wisdom, which is profitable to direct,<br/> may point
                    out the way. One of the Indians, a <a href=""#delaware"" class=""orgName"">De-<br/>laware</a>, that brought <a href=""#haupa1"" class=""persName"">captain Hendricks'</a> letter, says<br/> the western
                    Indians keep their runners constantly<br/> out to watch the motion of <a href=""#gwayn1"" class=""persName"">general
                        Wayne's</a> army,<br/> from whom they have some fearful apprehensions;<br/> which we

                    command at the defeat of St. Clair's army. He was<br/> richly dressed. His
                    appearance is lofty and mascu- <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_27," line.He said he had heard of the Quakers &#8212; that<br/> they were a
                    harmless people that did not fight; and<br/> was glad now to see us. We had also
                    a visit from<br/> several others of the same tribe. One of a solid<br/>
                    countenance said, he heartily desired we might<br/> succeed in the great work of
                    peace; and appeared<br/> much pleased to see us. We have several capable<br/>
                    interpreters with us; but our sentiments being peace-<br/>ful, serious and
                    religious, are so opposite to theirs,<br/> that when they do interpret, it is
                    with such reluc-<br/>tance as puts it out of our power to relieve our<br/> minds
                    so fully as we could wish. This day received<br/> a letter from the <a href=""#moraind"" class=""orgName"">Moravian Indians</a> and their
                    minis-<br/>ter, expressing their grateful sense of Friends' kind-<br/>ness to

                    First of the week. For some days I
                    have<br/> felt rather dull and heavy &#8212; my spirits low. I feel<br/> the
                    importance of our embassy with much weight. &#8212;<br/> The dark conversation
                    frequently heard respecting<br/> war, is truly distressing and discouraging. I
                    am <br/>frequently led to recur back to the first principles<br/> from whence
                    the concern took its rise; and have, as<br/> yet, no cause to doubt of its
                    propriety, although<br/> many discouraging prospects are frequently thrown<br/>
                    in our way. We are comfortably preserved in unity<br/> one with another in the
                    main cause we are engaged<br/> in, hoping we shall not be shaken from the
                    right<br/> ground by the enemies of peace, &#8212; of which there<br/> are many. </p>

                <p> This day we had another meeting in the usual<br/> place, which was large and
                    solid. </p>

                <p>
                    Had an interview with <a href=""#celli1"" class=""persName"">captain Elliot</a>, who<br/> had just returned from the
                        <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""geogName"">Rapids</a>, where the Indians<br/> are
                    collected; but nothing further has transpired.<br/> He appears somewhat
                    reserved; and our anxious<br/> state of suspense still continues. We are
                    apprehen- <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_29," sive the Indian embassy to the commissioners may<br/> prevent the
                    proposed treaty. We wrote a letter to <br/><a href=""#cmkee1"" class=""persName"">colonel
                        McKee</a>, and an epistle to the Indians, to be<br/> forwarded the
                    first opportunity. </p>

                <p> Here we observe a species of Indian slaves called<br/>
                    <a href=""#pawnee"" class=""orgName"">Pawnees</a>, or Punins, &#8212;
                    who are captives taken by<br/> the <a href=""#chippewa"" class=""orgName"">Chipaways</a> from the <a href=""#sioux"" class=""orgName"">Suse</a>, or <a href=""#pawnee"" class=""orgName"">Pawnee</a> nations.<br/> It is sorrowful
                    to think that a nation so famed for<br/> liberty, should hold them, and a number
                    of the Afri- <br/>can race, in a state of bondage during life. The
                    go-<br/>vernment here, we understand, has made some essay<br/> towards their
                    enlargement, which, it is hoped, will,<br/> in time, amount to a total
                    abolition. </p>

                    Had a solid opportunity with <a href=""#celli1"" class=""persName"">captain El-<br/>liot</a>, deputy agent for Indian
                    affairs, and again ex-<br/>pressed our anxious desires to him, that a solid
                    peace<br/> might take place; we also queried if it would be<br/> proper for us,
                    or any of our company, to visit the In-<br/>dians in their present council at
                    the <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""geogName"">Rapids</a>, where<br/> he was now about to
                    return. He told us, he thought<br/> in the present state of things, it would not
                    be eligi-<br/>ble to move that way. He gave us to understand,<br/> that the
                    Indians were generally acquainted with our<br/> being here, and our views
                    towards them; and hoped<br/> on the return of the Indian embassy, some way
                    would<br/> open for our relief. For the present, we concluded<br/> to forward
                    the letters to and the <a href=""#cmkee1"" class=""persName"">M'Kee</a> Indians, by<br/>
                    <a href=""#celli1"" class=""persName"">Elliot</a>, and as our having a personal interview
                    with<br/> the Indians appeared doubtful, we forwarded Friends'<br/> Address to
                    them, to be read by <a href=""#cmkee1"" class=""persName"">M'Kee</a> in case we<br/>
                    should fail of an opportunity ourselves. </p>

                    The people are very busy in their
                    harvest,<br/> having good crops: but in some places the grain is <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_30," injured by a kind of smut, supposed to be occasion-<br/>ed by much

                    Indians &#8212; as we hear hostilities<br/> between them and the whites have been
                    renewed to<br/> the southward. These accounts are alarming and<br/>
                    discouraging. The commissioners are not yet come.<br/> We wait as patiently as

                    This morning had an interview with
                        <a href=""#cwell2"" class=""persName"">cap-<br/>tain Wellbank</a>, who came with the
                    detachment of<br/> <a href=""#cherokee"" class=""orgName"">Cherokee</a> and
                    <a href=""#creek"" class=""orgName"">Creek</a> Indians from the southern ter-<br/>ritory,
                    he says, more than a thousand miles, and<br/> that they were ninety days on
                    their journey. His<br/> principal business seemed to be with <a href=""#cengl1"" class=""persName"">colonel
                        Eng-<br/>land</a> , who gave immediate orders for the sloop Feli-<br/>city to sail
                    with him on board, to <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName""> Fort Erie</a>, on his<br/>
                    way to <a href=""#gsim"" class=""persName"">governor Simcoe</a>. We suppose they
                    have<br/> some matters of importance, as colonel England<br/> a few days ago
                    assured us the Felicity was detained<br/> on purpose to take us to <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandusky</a>, or <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName"">Fort
                        Erie</a>,<br/> as was most eligible, on the shortest notice,
                    which<br/>looked kind and friendly to our purpose. </p>

            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-07-19"">19th</a>. <a href=""#detro"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    The weather fair and pleasant, and
                    through<br/> Divine favour, we are all in health ; but are still in<br/> great
                    suspense, with respect to the event of this in-<br/>tended treaty, which every
                    day looks more and<br/> more discouraging. Yet we think we have been in<br/> the
                    line of our duty in coming forward and labour-<br/>ing thus far; and hope our
                    being here may be of<br/> some use on divers accounts. Some of our compa- <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_31," ny walked yesterday to the spring about three miles<br/> below the
                    town, where they had a satisfactory op-<br/>portunity with some <a href=""#oneida"" class=""orgName"">Oneida Indians</a>
                    that were en-<br/>camped there. They seem jointly concerned with<br/> us for the
                    accomplishment of peace. This day we<br/> were all together in the arbour in the
                    colonel's gar-<br/>den, looking over some writings on Indian affairs.<br/> To
                    this place we frequently resort, as it is retired<br/> and pleasant &#8212; being
                    indulged with this privilege by<br/> invitation from the colonel soon after our
                    arrival<br/> here. </p>
            </div>

                    The harbour is now clear of shipping.
                    &#8212;<br/> We are anxiously waiting the arrival of the Dun-<br/>more, by which we
                    expect the commissioners, or to<br/> hear from them, hoping our detention here
                    will be<br/> shortly closed by our going on to <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandusky</a>, or re-<br/>turning to <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName"">Fort
                        Erie</a> on our way home: till which<br/> we desire humbly to submit
                    to the wise Disposer of<br/> events. </p>

                <p>
                    First of the week. We held a meeting
                    in<br/> the sail loft at the tenth hour, which was a favour-<br/>ed time, it
                    being large and solid. Soon after our re-<br/>turn, we heard of the arrival of
                    the Dunmore at the<br/> mouth of the river, by a passenger who came in her,<br/>
                    and that the commissioners are on board, expecting<br/> to go forward soon to
                        <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandusky</a>. In the afternoon<br/> we had
                    another comfortable meeting, crowned as<br/> we thought, with the Master's good
                    presence. And<br/> now it looks likely to be a parting one, &#8212; the peo-<br/>ple
                    behaved with remarkable quietness &#8212; manifest-<br/>ing much respect to us. I
                    believe there are a few<br/> tender-hearted ones in this place that will
                    remember<br/> us, and I hope we shall not forget them; &#8212; though it<br/> is
                    sorrowful to behold the power and influence that <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_32," satan has too generally amongst the inhabitants of<br/> these
                    parts. <a href=""#cgibs"" class=""persName"">Captain Gibbons</a>, who came passenger<br/>
                    in the Dunmore, gave us the above intelligence re-<br/>specting the
                    commissioners, and further says, the<br/> Indian deputies and they held a very
                    friendly con-<br/>ference together at <a href=""#nav"" class=""placeName"">Navy
                    Hall</a>, and things appeared<br/> in a favourable way respecting the
                    treaty. This ac-<br/>count is more pleasant than any we have had for<br/> many
                    days past. In this fluctuating state of things<br/> we find great need to keep
                    on the right bottom, so<br/> that we may not be shaken from that
                    foundation,<br/> and a humble confidence in the Divine power, which<br/>I trust
                    we felt in our embarkation. </p>

                    myself, paid<br/> a visit to the <a href=""#catholic"" class=""orgName"">Roman Catholic</a> priest, who appeared<br/> to
                    take it kind. We also had a short interview with<br/> the commandant, who has
                    manifested much respect<br/> to us during our long stay here, and now told
                    us,<br/> that nothing should be wanting that lay in his power<br/> to make our
                    way easy. </p>

                    We
                    now began to prepare for leav-<br/>ing <a href=""#detro"" class=""placeName"">Detroit</a>. The commandant visited us at our quar-<br/>ters, and
                    informed us he proposed going with us in<br/> the Dunmore to see the
                    commissioners. It seemed<br/> very pleasant to find that respect which it is
                    hoped<br/> may tend to strengthen the unity between them. &#8212;<br/> We should have
                    been glad to see the commissioners<br/> here, but understanding neither they nor
                    any others<br/> from a foreign state under military characters, are<br/>
                    admitted within the limits of this garrison, which<br/> includes the town that
                    consists of about one hun-<br/>dred houses; under which consideration we think
                    it<br/> cause of thankfulness for the indulgence, remarkable<br/> attention, and
                    kind treatment we have met with <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_33," during our six weeks stay in this place. This even-<br/>ing, paid
                    a short visit at <a href=""#crin1"" class=""persName"">commissary Rinold</a>'s, who,<br/>
                    with his wife and sensible daughter, appear to have<br/> as much solidity,
                    uprightness, and vital religion, as<br/> any in the place. There are a few
                    others we highly<br/> esteem, and towards whom we now feel a near
                    affec-<br/>tion on taking our solemn farewell. </p>

                    Took leave of most of our acquaintances
                    in<br/> town and went on board the Dunmore, in which<br/> were <a href=""#cengl1"" class=""persName"">colonel England</a> and several other officers;
                    fell<br/> down to the mouth of the river, about eighteen<br/> miles, and landed
                    at <a href=""#celli1"" class=""persName"">captain Elliot</a>'s, whose house<br/> the
                    commissioners had taken, being large and con-<br/>venient for their purpose. We
                    were truly glad to<br/> see them, and they us. Here the vessel is ordered<br/>
                    to lay until we are ready to go forward to <a href=""#sandu"" class=""placeName"">Sandus-<br/>ky</a>, which depends on the time the Indians say
                    they<br/> are ready. It was pleasant to behold the friend-<br/>ship apparent
                    between the <a href=""#cengl1"" class=""persName"">colonel</a> with the other<br/>
                    British officers, and our commissioners. This place<br/> is very agreeable;
                    there being a large farm, with<br/> fields well stored with grain, standing in
                    shock &#8212;<br/>supposed to be about one thousand bushels; a large<br/> new barn
                    eighty feet long and about thirty-six<br/>wide; round the house a beautiful
                    green, on which<br/> we encamped with fourteen tents, large and small,<br/>
                    containing our little company and the commission-<br/>ers' train, with some
                    British officers who designed<br/> to go with us to the grand treaty. The
                    commis-<br/>sioners gave us the substance of what passed be-<br/>tween them and
                    the Indian deputies at <a href=""#niaga"" class=""placeName"">Niagara</a>: all<br/>
                    which appeared encouraging, and favourable towards<br/> an accommodation. We
                    dined and supped all toge-<br/>ther, and slept quiet and well in our tents. </p>

                    A fine morning. Having an opportunity

                    First of the week. I felt weary with

                    a meeting. But towards evening, at<br/> about an hour's notice, we met at the
                    old sail loft<br/> with many of the inhabitants, who appeared glad of<br/> the
                    opportunity, and it was satisfactory to ourselves. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-07-29"">29th</a>. <a href=""#detro"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    The colonel's boat going down the river
                    to<br/> our camp, with <a href=""#cfree1"" class=""persName"">captains Freeman</a> and
                        <a href=""#jbroa1"" class=""persName"">Broadhead</a>,<br/> we were invited to return
                    with them; but our busi-<br/>ness not being completed, I concluded to stay,
                    and<br/> take my passage in the schooner Nancy, bound to<br/>
                    <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName"">Fort Erie</a>, and <a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName"">William
                        Savery</a> went with the offi-<br/>cers. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-07-30"">30th</a>. 
                <p>
                    I went on board the schooner, and near<br/>
                    night landed at our camp, where I was informed a<br/> deputation of Indians from
                    the <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""geogName"">Rapids</a> had been here,<br/> and held a
                    conference with the commissioners. They<br/> appeared uneasy with what had
                    passed at <a href=""#niaga"" class=""placeName"">Niagara</a>,<br/> asserting that
                    nothing short of <a href=""#ohior"" class=""geogName"">Ohio river</a> being the<br/>
                    line, would satisfy them; they requested the com-<br/>missioners&#8217; "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_35,"
                    answer to-morrow, on that head, and re-<br/>tired over the river. This
                    unexpected change look-<br/>ed again discouraging; believing our worthy
                    com-<br/>missioners had nothing but upright views in their<br/> proceedings,
                    consistent with the trust reposed in them<br/> by the government of the
                    United
                        States. Though<br/> what their views are, is yet unknown to us; but we<br/>
                    hope, and expect, they will be generous and liberal,<br/> evincing to the world
                    that the present proceedings<br/> and designs of the <a href=""#usag"" class=""orgName"">United
                        States</a> are founded on<br/> reason, equity, and justice. And so
                    far as this may<br/> be the case, we hope the Lord may be on our side,<br/> in
                    this our trying situation. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-07-31"">31st</a>. 
                <p>
                    In the afternoon the Indians came over,
                    and<br/> being seated on the beautiful green in the shade of<br/> some trees,
                    the commissioners came forth with their<br/> speech in writing, which was
                    interpreted by <a href=""#tjones"" class=""persName"">Tho-<br/>mas Jones</a>, from the
                    <a href=""#genec"" class=""placeName"">Genesee</a>, in
                    the Seneca lan-<br/>guage. In it was contained many candid and gen-<br/>erous
                    proposals; but not coming up so fully to their<br/> demands as they seemed to
                    wish, they declined to<br/> make any reply at present. But having the paper<br/>
                    given to them, said they would consider it mature-<br/>ly, and return an answer
                    tomorrow. On which the<br/> council broke up, and the Indians returned again to<br/>
                    <a href=""#whiti"" class=""geogName"">Whitewood Island</a>, opposite to our camp.
                    Among<br/> these were the chiefs often different nations, who ap-<br/>peared in
                    council solid and sober. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-08-01"">8th mo. 1st</a>. 
                <p>
                    The Indian deputies returned in
                    the<br/> morning early, and being seated, the <a href=""#wyandot"" class=""orgName"">Wyandot</a> chief<br/> called
                    <a href=""#carry1"" class=""persName"">Carry-all-about</a>, whose name signifies King of<br/> all the western nations up
                    the Lakes, &#8212; made a short<br/> speech, importing, That many treaties had
                    been<br/> held at different places from time to time, wherein <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_36," you say lands have been purchased; but would ac-<br/>knowledge no
                    legal and permanent conveyance<br/> since the treaty at <a href=""#fstan"" class=""placeName"">Fort Stanwix</a>, twenty-five years<br/> ago. So that the lands on
                    this side the <a href=""#ohior"" class=""geogName""> Ohio</a> are<br/> ours, and the
                    lands on the other side are yours. &#8212; <br/>
                 And you may go home and tell <a href=""#gwash1"" class=""persName"">Washington</a>
                    what<br/> we say. We understand all you said to us very<br/> well, and we expect
                    you understand us. <a href=""#sgirt1"" class=""persName"">Simon<br/> Girty</a> was their
                    interpreter. After rising up and<br/> stepping off a few yards, they found a
                    mistake in<br/> expression, and recalled their words, desiring the<br/>
                    commissioners would stay where they are, till they<br/> could go to the council
                    and return with an answer,<br/> which, if favoured with wind and weather, may
                    be<br/> accomplished in about five days. We had some de-<br/>sire to go with
                    them to the <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""placeName"">Rapids</a>, as
                    <a href=""#celli1"" class=""persName"">captain El-<br/>liot</a>,
                        <a href=""#cmkee1"" class=""persName"">captain Thomas M&#8217;Kee</a>, and others were
                    go-<br/>ing to the council. But this was not approbated;<br/> and as our letters
                    sent by <a href=""#celli1"" class=""persName"">captain Elliot</a> had not<br/> been
                    forwarded by him on account of his meeting<br/> the commissioners here, who
                    thought proper to de-<br/>tain them, concluding we should have an
                    opportu-<br/>nity shortly to see them ourselves, &#8212; after opening<br/> and
                    reading them, and adding a short postscript, we<br/> were encouraged to send
                    them forward, though at a<br/> late stage.</p>

                    Towards evening, several of us in
                    company<br/> with our good old general, took a walk up the river<br/> about a
                    mile, and drank tea at <a href=""#jcol"" class=""persName"">James Colwell</a>&#8217;s. The<br/>
                    result of this great business is cause of much close<br/> exercise at times &#8212;
                    our minds being made sensible<br/> that nothing but supernatural wisdom will do
                    for us<br/> to lean to. </p>

                    The sloop Detroit came to, here, on her way <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_37," to <a href=""#ferie"" class=""placeName"">Fort Erie</a>, from
                    <a href=""#michi"" class=""placeName""> Michillimackinac</a>, loaded with<br/>
                    peltry, having on board three hundred and
                    thirty-<br/> three packs, the greatest part supposed to be worth<br/> twenty
                    guineas each. So great is the fur trade in<br/> this country, that it is almost
                    beyond description.<br/> In the afternoon, <a href=""#jelli1"" class=""persName"">John
                        Elliott</a> and myself took a<br/> walk to <a href=""#sgirt1"" class=""persName"">Simon Girty</a>'s, and from thence about half<br/> a mile further
                    down the lake, where we saw some<br/> plain traces of one of the very old forts,
                    among the<br/> many that are in divers parts of this country, of<br/> which the
                    present Indians can give no account from<br/> tradition or otherwise. </p>

                    First of the week. We held a small
                    meet-<br/>ing at <a href=""#sgirt1"" class=""persName"">Simon Girty</a>'s, we hope to
                    profit: &#8212; himself<br/> gone to the Indian council with the deputies that<br/>
                    were here from the Rapids.<a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName""> William Savery</a>
                    and<br/> myself being comrades in a small tent, our bedding<br/> got a good deal
                    wet with the great rain that fell to-<br/>day, and having no opportunity for
                    drying, we slept<br/> on them as they were. In the morning, felt well,<br/>
                    which is an additional cause of thankfulness for the<br/> many favours we have
                    received. </p>

                    We have frequent visits from the town,
                    &#8212;<br/> and this day came <a href=""#jabbo1"" class=""persName"">James Abbot</a>,
                        <a href=""#wbo"" class=""persName"">William Bow</a>, and<br/> &#8212; Sportsman, in a small
                    sail boat. Our friend<br/>
                    <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a>, paid a visit to the 
                    <a href=""#wyandot"" class=""orgName"">Wyandot</a>
                    Indian<br/> town about four miles from our camp. This night<br/> was the most
                    general complaint of the musketoes I<br/> have yet heard since our encamping
                    here. Most of<br/> us got little sleep either in the house, tents, or on<br/>
                    ship board. Towards day the weather grew colder<br/> &#8212; wind N. W. which caused
                    an increase of muske-<br/>toes in our tents. </p>

                <p>
                    One of the servants of <a href=""#celli1"" class=""persName"">captain Elliot</a>, called <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_38,"
                    <a href=""#tob"" class=""persName"">Toby</a>, a <a href=""#pawnee"" class=""orgName"">Pawnee</a> slave, who has lain near a year
                    in<br/> a consumption, died about two o'clock this afternoon. </p>
                <p> I was with him for about an hour before he depart-<br/>ed, and speaking with him
                    about fifteen minutes be-<br/>fore he breathed his last, found he was sensible
                    of<br/> death being upon him. He said he understood all<br/> I said to him, and
                    was glad he was noticed in his<br/> last moments. I think I never saw before so
                    hasty<br/> a burial. His coffin was made immediately, and his<br/> interment
                    took place about sunset, in a grave near-<br/>by on the bank of the river,
                    attended by about twen-<br/>ty people, whites, blacks, and Indians. This
                    was<br/> the end of poor <a href=""#tob"" class=""persName"">Toby</a>. </p>

                    from the south, with much<br/> rain.<a href=""#wcol"" class=""persName"">William</a> and
                    I got a little wet again, but are<br/> preserved in health. </p>

                    <a href=""#fvntns"" class=""orgName"">Five Nations</a>, announcing his opinion there<br/> will be peace. This was
                    pleasant, indeed, and we<br/> sat up this evening, conversing with the
                    commis-<br/>sioners till past eleven o'clock. Slept well, being<br/> clear of

                        <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""geogName"">Ra-<br/>pids</a>, whose reports agree in

                    letters. They were treated with a glass<br/> a piece, and encamped near by; but
                    a canoe coming<br/> from <a href=""#detro"" class=""placeName"">Detroit</a> with rum,
                    they were made very noisy.<br/> This, with the musketoes, caused little sleep.

                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_39," the council, for which we are very anxious. The<br/> season
                    advancing, and the great distance we are<br/> from home, together with the
                    continued uncertainty<br/> of succeeding, according to our wishes, in the
                    great<br/> business we are engaged in, accompanied with other<br/> unpleasant

                    First of the week. No arrival from the
                    <a href=""#miamr1"" class=""geogName"">Ra-<br/>pids </a> to alleviate our strong desires and 
                    anxiety to see<br/> the

                        Isle</a>, where we held a meeting with some of its in-<br/>habitants

                    No remarkable occurrence. We are still<br/>

                    This day we had the company of <a href=""#cwell2"" class=""persName"">captain<br/> Wellbank</a>, who returned some days ago
                    from <a href=""#niafo"" class=""placeName"">Nia-<br/>gara </a>. He gave the

                    <br/>We have a <a href=""#wyandot"" class=""orgName"">Wyandot</a>
                    Indian, who stays much with<br/> us. He often goes out to hunt, and brings in
                    plenty<br/> of ducks, &amp;c. for which he gets well paid. He ap-<br/>pears to
                    be a sensible man, speaks many languages<br/> in the Indian tongue and some
                    English. Two men<br/> came from the other side of the river, and informed<br/>
                    the boats were coming from the council to invite us <br/>to the treaty. </p>

            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-08-16"">16th</a>.
                <p>
                    In the afternoon came two young Indian<br/>
                    men, (<a href=""#wyandot"" class=""orgName"">Wyandots</a>) they
                    looked wild and afraid; one<br/> of them was introduced to <a href=""#glinc1"" class=""persName"">general Lincoln</a>, and<br/> handed him a message in
                    writing, from the great<br/> council, informing, that the several treaties at
                        <a href=""#fmint"" class=""placeName"">Fort<br/> M'Intosh</a>, <a href=""#miam"" class=""placeName"">Miami</a>, <a href=""#musk"" class=""placeName"">Muskingum</a>, &amp;c,
                    where lands<br/> had been ceded by two or three nations only, were<br/> not
                    valid, as they had no right to cede lands. And<br/> as for the large sums of
                    money proposed to be given<br/> for their country, they did not want it, and a
                    great<br/> many of them did not know the use of it: therefore<br/> desired it
                    might be applied with the proposed sala-<br/>ry, to the indemnification of the
                    settlers north of<br/> the <a href=""#ohio"" class=""placeName"">Ohio</a>. And as they
                    supposed they were mostly<br/> poor people, or they would not have settled on
                    dis-<br/>puted lands, they now proposed that government <br/> should give the
                    money to them. It would be a suf-<br/>ficient compensation to those settlers,
                    and might in-<br/>duce them to move quietly somewhere else, out of<br/> the
                    Indian country &#8212; and make the <a href=""#ohior"" class=""geogName"">Ohio</a> the
                    bounda-<br/>ry: for it was their land. And signified, as the<br/> land to the
                    westward was filled up, they had no-<br/>where to repair to, and were now
                    determined to lay <br/>"new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_41," their bones in that country. As to the
                    concessions<br/> the commissioners proposed making, by giving mo-<br/>ney, they
                    did not want it; and running a new line<br/> was but giving them a part of their
                    own land. And<br/> as to disclaiming the right to all their country by<br/>
                    virtue of the peace made with the king, their father,<br/> they knew they never
                    were conquered, and the pre-<br/>emption right agreed on by the British and
                    United<br/> States, concerning the purchasing of their country,<br/> could not
                    be binding on them; for they supposed<br/> they had a right to sell their lands
                    to whom they<br/> pleased. Upon the whole, it was received as a very<br/>
                    contemptible speech, by our commissioners &#8212; which<br/> soon appeared to be the
                    case, as the baggage was<br/> ordered on board, and caused an alarm in our camp. </p>
                <p> Some for safety proposed to lodge on board the ship,<br/> and divers tents were
                    struck. Some went on board,<br/> and others took to the house for safety. This
                    pros-<br/>pect, all on a sudden, looked gloomy, and Friends<br/> got together to
                    feel if any thing further opened for<br/> us to do. We felt much shut up; &#8212; and
                    as we had <br/> never been called into council with the commission-<br/>ers, nor
                    had any public conference with the Indians,<br/> we were obliged to bear our own
                    burthens, and sub-<br/>mit the awful subject to the interposition of the
                    Di-<br/>vine hand, and turn our faces homeward to our dear<br/> friends and
                    connections, in hopes of reaching our<br/> Yearly Meeting. </p>

                <p> This evening, two runners who were despatched<br/> three days ago, returned with
                    a verbal message from<br/> the <a href=""#fvntns"" class=""orgName"">Five Nations</a>, who
                    expected us to come for-<br/>ward, and were moving six miles down the river
                    to<br/> meet us. They having all along appeared very<br/> friendly to the
                        <a href=""#usag"" class=""orgName"">United States</a>, this appeared an art-
                        <br/>"new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_42," ful manoeuvre, on one side or the other. It was<br/>
                    somewhat extraordinary to hear <a href=""#glinc1"" class=""persName"">general Lincoln</a>
                    ex-<br/>press, that they had received just such an answer as<br/> he could have
                    wished. What his meaning was, is<br/> unknown. Friends slept in their tents as
                    heretofore,<br/> I believe with little fear. </p>

                <p>
                    We were hurried on board soon after
                    break-<br/>fast, with the remainder of ""our baggage. Two run-<br/>ners were
                    dispatched by the commissioners to the<br/>
                    <a href=""#sxntns"" class=""orgName"">Six Nations</a>, the object unknown to us. About
                    ele-<br/>ven o'clock, we were all on board, and stood down<br/> the river into
                    the lake. My mind felt sorrowful and<br/> very heavy, reflecting on the
                    important subject of<br/> our journey; but I could see nothing material
                    omit-<br/>ted on our part, to give uneasiness: so I endeavoured<br/> to rest
                    quiet, leaving the event to Him who judgeth<br/> righteously. In this part of
                    the world, but little mo-<br/>rality, law, or religion, appears to govern the
                    peo-<br/>ple, though the climate is blessed with health and<br/> there is plenty
                    of the good things of this life; no-<br/>thing being wanting but industry and
                    thankful<br/> hearts. </p>

                    First of the week. We came to anchor<br/>
                    among a cluster of islands in the west end of the<br/> lake; of which there is
                    said to be about thirty, great<br/> and small. Some of them produce abundance of
                    red<br/> cedar, much used in ship building &#8212; there are also<br/> raccoons and
                    many other wild animals on them. We<br/> stood out into the open lake with
                    pleasant weather.<br/> Had a season of solid retirement in the cabin, with <br/>
                    a few of our fellow passengers, to a good degree of<br/>satisfaction and
                    comfort; though held in much con-<br/>tempt by others, who supposed themselves
                    wise and <br/> good enough already. </p>

                    at the close,<br/> we had a select opportunity with such as profess<br/> with
                    Friends, a number of them being members, to<br/> whom some interesting matters
                    of advice were com-<br/>municated. Upon the whole, we thought it a very<br/>
                    solid and profitable opportunity, many hearts being<br/>tendered; for whom, in
                    their lonely situation, we<br/> were brought into near sympathy. We parted
                    from<br/> them in much love. <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a> and
                    myself went<br/> to <a href=""#ezden"" class=""persName"">Ezekiel Dennis</a>'s, up the

                    decent<br/> looking young people, with innocent countenances,<br/> were present;
                    on account of whom I felt much con-<br/>cern for their religious and school

                    board<br/> the Dunmore on a small errand, with our friend <a href=""#wlund1"" class=""persName"">Wil-<br/>liam Lundy</a>, who having heard of our being here,<br/>
                    came about twenty miles to see us, and was at the<br/> meeting to-day. In the
                    evening went to our friend<br/>
                    <a href=""#bwill1"" class=""persName"">Benjamin Willson</a>'s &#8212; leaving the other Friends
                    at<br/> Powell's. <a href=""#jelli1"" class=""persName"">John Elliott </a>had been very

                    night came on, and we<br/> halted by the side of a small brook, and began
                    to<br/> make preparation for a shelter, but a cloud came on<br/> with heavy
                    thunder and rain. We made out to get<br/> a fire kindled, which was a comfort to
                    us; but we<br/> got very wet. The wind being high, several trees<br/> fell near
                    us, which was somewhat alarming. The<br/> gust held about two hours, and then
                    cleared up with<br/> bright starlight the remainder of the night. We all<br/>
                    lay before the fire, in the best manner we could, in<br/>our wet situation, got
                    some sleep, but were some<br/>what afflicted with the musketoes. On the

                    rode two miles to the <a href=""#bhous"" class=""placeName"">Block-house</a>, where we
                    took<br/> breakfast, and gave our horses as much oats as we<br/> thought would

                    favoured. After dinner, went back six miles to <a href=""#sharr"" class=""persName"">Sa-<br/>muel Harris</a>'s, over the very large and rapid creek<br/>
                    called <a href=""#loyac"" class=""geogName"">Loyalsock</a>. Here we had a large and

                    Our friend S. H., an ancient man, has
                    lain<br/> poorly for some time, and not likely to continue<br/> long. He seems
                    quiet and calm, and told me this<br/> morning, he felt bravely refreshed, and

                    took a solemn leave of him and the family, and pro-<br/>ceeded to <a href=""#swall1"" class=""persName"">Wallace</a>'s. We then all set out together,<br/> and

                    an ancient Friend, now in<br/> the ninety-seventh year of her age. We had
                    no<br/> public meeting here, but visited most of the families<br/> of Friends in
                    town, wherein our friend <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Par-<br/>rish</a>
                    had good service, and was much favoured. In<br/> the afternoon we rode about
                    nine miles to <a href=""#roarc"" class=""placeName"">Roaring<br/> creek </a>. This part

                    First of the week. <a href=""#jwrig1"" class=""persName"">Joseph Wright</a>, living<br/> in one part of the house with his
                    family, has lately<br/> been afflicted with the bloody flux, by which he
                    had<br/> lost three children. Divers Friends came here to<br/> see us, viz.
                        <a href=""#jstar1"" class=""persName"">John Starr</a>, <a href=""#twrig1"" class=""persName"">Thomas
                        Wright</a>, <a href=""#lpilk"" class=""persName"">Levi Pil-<br/>kington</a>,
                    &amp;c. We all attended their sa meeting at <a href=""#maide"" class=""orgName"">Mai-<br/>den
                        creek</a> &#8212; and after dinner proceeded nine miles to<br/> <a href=""#readi"" class=""placeName"">Reading,</a>
                    where we put up at <a href=""#sjack1"" class=""persName"">Samuel Jackson</a>'s. &#8212;<br/>
                    The sickness, and distress in consequence thereof,<br/> we still hear confirmed,
                    and much talked of, as still<br/> raging to a great degree in <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName""> Philadelphia</a> &#8212; which, I <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_51," expect will be a trying circumstance to many friends<br/> in the
                    country, in getting to our ensuing Yearly<br/> Meeting. May the good hand be
                    near to help us. </p>

                    <a href=""#swall1"" class=""persName"">Samuel
                        Wallace</a>, from <a href=""#muncy"" class=""placeName"">Muncy</a>, called to
                    see<br/> us. He left the city yesterday, and confirms the<br/> accounts of the
                    sickness and mortality to be quite<br/> equal to what we have heard &#8212; and that
                    the principal<br/> nurses for the sick, and buriers of the dead, are the<br/>
                    blacks, of whom it is said, very few or none have<br/> yet taken the disorder.
                    After breakfast we set out<br/> and rode twenty-three miles to <a href=""#jpot"" class=""persName"">Joseph Potts</a>'s, <br/>where we lodged. Here we again
                    heard much of<br/> the distressed situation of <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName"">
                        Philadelphia</a>. Our friend<br/>
                    <a href=""#jelli1"" class=""persName"">John Elliott</a> left <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John
                        Parrish</a> and myself here, pro-<br/>posing to ride into town this
                    evening to his family. </p>

                <p>
                    I have been these two days past,
                    poorly<br/> with a cold, and very hoarse; but through favour, this<br/> morning,
                    feel some better. <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a> was taken<br/>
                    in a carriage by a friend, proposing to go to <a href=""#darby"" class=""placeName"">Darby</a>,<br/> where he understands his wife was gone,
                    intending<br/> to go by <a href=""#jfiel"" class=""persName"">John Field</a>'s, who with
                    many others are<br/> out of town. At the same time I set out with my<br/> friend
                        <a href=""#jpot"" class=""persName"">Joseph Potts</a>, and rode nine miles to
                        <a href=""#germa"" class=""placeName"">German-<br/>town</a>. Called at <a href=""#hdrin1"" class=""persName"">Henry Drinker</a>'s, who with his<br/> family were here.
                    From thence went with <a href=""#hdrin1"" class=""persName"">Henry</a><br/> to <a href=""#jpemb1"" class=""persName"">John Pemberton</a>'s, who was here also with his
                    <br/>family. Having heard that <a href=""#grand1"" class=""persName"">Beverly
                        Randolph</a> was<br/> at his cousin <a href=""#erand1"" class=""persName"">Edmund
                        Randolph</a>'s, the attorney ge-<br/>neral of 
                    the United States,
                    about three miles from<br/> this, and being desirous to see him, towards
                    even-<br/>ing, <a href=""#jpemb1"" class=""persName"">John Pemberton</a>, <a href=""#hdrin1"" class=""persName"">Henry Drinker</a> and myself<br/> went there in
                        <a href=""#jpemb1"" class=""persName"">John</a>'s carriage. We were glad to see<br/>
                    each other again, and after spending about an hour <br/>and a half together in
                    free conversation, returned to <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_52,"
                    <a href=""#germa"" class=""placeName""/>Germantown, where I lodged at my friend <a href=""#jjohn1"" class=""persName"">John<br/> Johnson</a>'s. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-09-20"">20th</a>. <a href=""#germa"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    The weather dry and warm &#8212; thought to
                    be<br/> rather unfavorable to the sick in the city, where<br/> deaths and
                    burials are frequent through the day. &#8212;<br/> Here I met with my friend <a href=""#slund1"" class=""persName"">Sarah Lundy</a>, who is<br/> on her way to the Yearly
                    Meeting, and a proposed<br/> visit to the Southern States. Also, again met
                    with<br/> my dear friend, <a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName"">William Savery</a>, who
                    came in last<br/> evening, his wife being here, and having taken<br/> lodgings
                    at <a href=""#chain1"" class=""persName"">Caspar Haines</a>'s. We were all together<br/>
                    at their <a href=""#germpm"" class=""orgName"">preparative meeting</a>, where divers weighty<br/> testimonies were
                    delivered by <a href=""#slund1"" class=""persName"">Sarah Lundy</a> and<br/> others; and
                    solemn supplication by <a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName"">William Savery</a>.<br/>
                    <a href=""#whart"" class=""persName"">Wm. Hartshorne</a> returned home from
                        <a href=""#newyo"" class=""placeName"">New York</a>, <br/>well. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-09-21"">21st</a>. <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    This being the day for opening our select
                    <br/><a href=""#pym"" class=""orgName"">Yearly Meeting</a>, it was exceedingly trying to many<br/> Friends, on account
                    of the prevailing and mortal<br/> disorder raging in the city, where it is said
                    from a <br/>hundred to a hundred and fifty of a day, have been<br/> taken to
                    their graves. I was much exercised in<br/> mind on that account, being yet
                    poorly with my<br/> cold, which 1 now apprehend to be what is common-<br/>ly
                    called the influenza; &#8212; however, on the whole, I<br/> thought I felt most easy
                    to go forward, and rode<br/> into <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName"">Philadelphia</a>, attended the meeting at Fourth<br/> street, which
                    was a solid, favoured time, though <br/>very small. There were some Friends from
                    every<br/> Quarter, though many of the representatives were<br/> absent. I think
                    from one meeting there was but<br/> one answered. The number on the women's
                    side<br/> of the house, in the whole, twenty-four. I dined at<br/>
                    <a href=""#twist1"" class=""persName"">Thomas Wistar</a>'s, and towards evening returned
                    to <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_53,"
                    <a href=""#germa"" class=""placeName"">Germantown</a>, feeling myself very poorly with
                    great<br/> debility. While in the city, I had occasion to pass<br/> by Friends'
                    burial ground, the <a href=""#pfiel"" class=""geogName"">Potter's field</a>-, and<br/>
                    several others. The prospect was awful and alarm-<br/>ing, to behold the many
                    new graves, and others dig-<br/>ging, with the hearses standing, and some
                    coming<br/> and going &#8212; most of which were attended by the<br/> black people,
                    whom it is said the disorder has not <br/>reached. This is a token of mercy,
                    mixed with<br/> judgment, both to them and the whites, they being<br/> the
                    principal nurses and carriers of the dead. I am<br/> hardly able to describe my
                    feelings on the present<br/> occasion, believing it to be all in wisdom, and
                    hoping<br/> it may have a tendency to bring the lofty from their<br/> seats, and
                    beget greater humility than has of latter<br/> time appeared in that highly
                    favoured city. </p>

                    First of the week. The weather much
                    the<br/> same as many days past. I felt very weak and poor-<br/>ly; did not go
                    out to meeting, but kept in my quar-<br/>ters, where I was very kindly and
                    tenderly treated,<br/> wanting for nothing the house could afford to make<br/>
                    me comfortable. <a href=""#jjohn2"" class=""persName"">John Johnson</a> and his wife
                        <a href=""#rjohn2"" class=""persName""/>Rachel,<br/> appear to be tender-hearted,
                    sympathizing friends,<br/> blessed with a plenty of the good things of this
                    life,<br/> and an open disposition to communicate freely to<br/> those that are
                    in need. May the Lord reward them,<br/> as good stewards of the manifold favours
                    received. </p>

                    This day our general <a href=""#pym"" class=""orgName"">Yearly Meeting</a>
                    be-<br/>gins, at ten o'clock in the morning. I much desired<br/> to be there;
                    but remaining poorly, concluded to lay<br/> by another day for rest. I think I
                    now feel the ef-<br/>fects of hard riding through the wilderness, and
                    ly-<br/>ing on the damp ground; being stiffened, with sore-<br/>ness in my
                    bones. <a href=""#jelli1"" class=""persName"">John Elliott</a>, I hear, has been <br/>
                    "new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml,new_Joseph_SW_JM1793.xml_pg_54," poorly since his arrival in town. Neither he nor<br/>
                    <a href=""#jparr1"" class=""persName"">John Parrish</a> was at meeting on seventh-day.
                        <a href=""#jlind1"" class=""persName"">Jacob<br/> Lindley</a>, <a href=""#wsave1"" class=""persName"">William Savery</a> and myself were there,<br/> and glad to see each
                    other again in that place; and<br/> many friends expressed their gladness at our
                    safe<br/> return. </p>

            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-09-24"">24th</a>. <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    The weather dry and warm, the roads
                    very<br/> dusty. This morning felt better. Leaving my horse<br/> here, I rode
                    into town with my friend <a href=""#jjohn2"" class=""persName"">John John-<br/>son</a>,
                    in a chair&#8212; attended two sittings of our Yearly<br/> Meeting, which was much
                    smaller than usual. Our<br/> friend <a href=""#nwai1"" class=""persName"">Nicholas
                        Wain</a>, was again chosen clerk for<br/> the present year; and the
                    business went on in much <br/>brotherly love and concord &#8212; a good degree of
                    so-<br/>lemnity and weight attending. I lodged at <a href=""#thou1"" class=""persName"">Thomas<br/>
                        Hough&gt;</a>'s. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-09-25"">25th</a>. <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    The weather much the same. I continue<br/>
                    tolerable well in health; but weak and some cough.<br/> Attended the meeting as
                    yesterday. Dined at <a href=""#nwai1"" class=""persName"">N.<br/> Wain</a>'s, and lodged
                    at <a href=""#jjam3"" class=""persName"">John James</a>'s. </p>
            </div>
            <div type=""entry""><a when=""1793-09-26"">26th</a>, and fifth of the week. <a href=""#phila"" class=""placeName""/>
                <p>
                    The meeting
                    assem-<br/>bledagain at nine o'clock, and the business conclu-<br/>ded before
                    twelve, in solemn quiet, and, I believe,<br/> to the satisfaction of all
                    present. After which, I <br/>dined with my friend <a href=""#dbaco1"" class=""persName"">David
                        Bacon</a>, and returned to <br/><a href=""#germa"" class=""placeName"">Germantown</a> with my kind friend, <a href=""#jjohn2"" class=""persName"">John
                        Johnson</a>,<br/> who had also attended all the sittings of this
                    Yearly<br/> Meeting. The sickness in town continues as here-<br/>tofore. Divers
                    friends in the city are paying con-<br/>stant attention to the sick &#8212; providing
                    necessaries,<br/> nurses, coffins, and carriers of the dead. At which<br/> I
                    felt glad, and hope they will be rewarded for their<br/> labours in so great and
                    charitable a work. </p>
